<para>
Purpose of Reputation:
- Can work as a plot hook by letting NPCs have knowledge of the character's deeds and seek him out for a job.
- Characters can be reconized on the streets - for better or for worse. Potential plot hook.

Should reputation be a binary scale? Ex: balancing between Fame and Infamy.
Or should it simply be a measure of how known the character is - regardless
of how "positive" or "negative" this would be?
</para>

<para>
Purpose of Insanity:
Some places and situations will seriously affect a character's state of sanity.
(Ex: The howling winds of Pandemonium). The Insanity heap could be a measure
of a character's current state of mental health. The more a character is
exposed to dementing situations the higher the heap will be.

How to decrease the heap? I.e. how to get rid of insanity?
Checks involving Will Power and maybe Psyche.
