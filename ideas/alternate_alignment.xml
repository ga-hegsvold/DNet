<title>An alternative to alignment</title>
<para>
Need one or more gauges/scales which indicates a characters moral standings.
The character position on these gauges/scales will influence
where his soul will go after death.
Those adhering to a diety will probably go where the diety decides,
depending on how faithfull they have been. Need a way to measure this.
Also need a way of measuring moral standings of characters not adhering to a
diety.
</para>

<para>
Proposal #1:
A set of binary scales where each scale is poled by two opposing concepts.
</para>

<para>
During play, characters will slide back and forth on these scales depending
on their actions and intentions. When they finally die, the position they
have on the various scales will determen to what Outer Plane their soul will
go to. Their position on the scales will also influence how well they fit in
and how confortable they will be when visiting the Outer Planes.

A macabre example:
Consider a Mage skilled in Portal/Travel magic (and maybe som Soul magic).
One way he might do a Planeshift spell could be to seek out a person
with matching "moral" as the plane he wish to travel to. Then, through some
sort of ritual the Mage could release the victims soul from his physical
body and let it find its way to the Plane it belongs. The Mage would then
be able to use this "conduit" as an express route and hitch-hike to the
intended Plane. Nifty! :-)
</para>

<para>
A character's position on the various scales will to some degree be reflected
on the character's Aura.
