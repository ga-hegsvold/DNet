<equation>
	<title>Gift and Flaw Cost</title>
  <mathphrase>Cost = Base Cost x Severity x Frequency</mathphrase>
</equation>

<para>
All factors range from 1 to 5 [1:5].
Gifts have positive Severity.
Flaws have negative Severity.
</para>

<para>
Purpose of Base Cost (BC):
    To scale the cost of gifts and flaws to the same "range" as skills
    and specialties. BC for gifts and flaws probably be the average of
    skills and specialties BC range.
    Ex: Skills &amp; Specs BC range: [1:5] => Gift &amp; Flaw BC: (1+5)/2 = 3.
</para>

<para>
Purpose of Severity (SEV):
    To scale the cost of gifts and flaws depending on how impacting
    they will be during game play when it comes into play.
</para>

<para>
Purpose of Frequency (FRQ):
    To scale the cost of gifts and flaws depending on how often they
    come into play.
</para>
