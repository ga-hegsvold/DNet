Key factors that determine the lethality of a weapon: Control, Impact and Range
</para>

<para>
Control: How easy the weapon is to use.
</para>

<para>
Impact: The degree of damage that can be done with the weapon, depending on
the weapon's mass and velocity of the part that hits the target.
Momentum p = mv, where m is the object's constant mass and v the velocity.

<title>Thoughts on combat actions</title>
<para>
Every combatant can do 1 offensive action per round unless otherwise specified.
For each additional offensive action taken during a round, a penalty of 5 is subtracted from ALL actions that round.
So making an additional attack will reduce both attacks AND all defences by 5 for that round.

[Offensive action penalty = -5 x (# of attacks - 1)
</para>

<para>
Every combatant is considered to defend themselves unless otherwise specified and will get to defend against all incoming attacks.
However, defending against multiple opponents is more difficult than defending against a single opponent.
For each opponent except the first, all defence checks are done with a -5 penalty.
So defending against two opponents will reduce both defence checks by 5.
Defending against three opponents will reduce all three defence checks by 10, and so on.

[Defensive action penalty = -5 x (# of opponents - 1)
</para>

<para>
Offensive and defensive action penalties are cumulative.
</para>

<example>
Making two attacks against two opponents in addition to defending against both of them will result in a total penalty of -10 on all actions:
-5 for the additional attack
-5 for defending against the second opponent
= -10
</example>
