This spell allows a mage to lift and move as he wishes an object or
being of up to 90kg during 15 minutes. The mage always controls the
movement, which is limited to a maximum speed of 6 meters per round (1
m/s) with a fair maneuverability (90 degrees turn in a round). If the
caster is also the target of the spell, he controls his own movement.

An initial AGI resistance roll against TD 0 is allowed to negate the
effects of the spell. This roll is not required in the case of a
willing or inanimate target.

> [almost the same as Wizards flight, except that another being can
>  control the movement]

This spell allows the mage or another intelligent being to lift and
move an object or being of up to 90kg during 15 minutes. The mage must
touch the controller of the movement during the casting. If the
controller of the movement is also the target of the spell, then this
being can fly with full control over his direction and speed. Of
course, the mage must tell to the target which mechanism he sets up
for him to control the spell. This mechanism can involve movement,
words, simple thoughts, etc.

The movement is limited to a maximum speed of 6 meters per round (1
m/s) with a fair maneuverability (90 degrees turn in a round). An
initial AGI resistance roll against TD 0 is allowed to negate the
effects of the spell. This roll is not required in the case of a
willing or inanimate target.

Source TD: 8
Conductor TD: 3
Fatigue: 2
Casting time: 1 rounds (3 seconds)
Duration: 8 Minutes
Range: 30 Meters
Resisting TD: 5 vs. Running (or STR)

Description: The Slow spell will slow a target's movement
by 25m/round unless they make a Running check versus TD=5
(if they succeed they are only slowed by 12.5 m/round, a
critical success negates the spell).
