Hi...

I just wanted to get some feedback on the general principle
behind the character generation system I'm trying to develop.

I like point based systems because they are fair, but they have
a tendancy to make characters to stale and predictable. On the
other hand I like the randomness of "roll up" systems but with this
type of system it's the lack of fairness that bothers me.

What I've tried to comeup with is a system based on "Dynamic
Equilibrium" (sounds flash and will look real good if I ever 
figure out how to spell it) Which is divided into two main
parts

The general principle of the first part is that if
you have 12 attributes that all range from 2 to 12. You use
2D6 for each of the first six attributes and then subtract 
each of these values from 14 to provide the next six values.
So say you roll 3,10,11,5,9,4 you next six values are (14-3) 11,
(14-10) 2, (14-11) 3, (14-5) 9, (14-9) 5, (14-4) 10.

This makes the rolling up fair, all the characters will have the
same total number of points in all their attributes, and yet
at the same time it keeps the randomness.

The second principle is the link between opposing attributes
Say you have two attributes LOGIC and INTUITION. If we were
using the system that is described, opposing attributes could
be paired off. So that a player rolled 2D6 for their character's
LOGIC and then subtracted that value from 14 to provide the
characters intuition.

One of the problems is that I'm having trouble pairing off
attributes. LOGIC & INTUITION is fine but finding other pairs
is difficult.

Anyway I was just wondering if people thought this would work.
Thanks for reading...Bye!
