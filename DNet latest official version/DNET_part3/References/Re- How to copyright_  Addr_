Copyright Office Forms Hotline (202) 707-9100 (TTY: 707-6737)

The procedure for copyrighting seems to vary somewhat, I suggest you
try to get a copy of their "Copyright Basics" booklet. I'll quote some
material from the document which might answer your other questions:

"Registration Procedures

In General

A. To register a work, send the following three elements *in the same
envelope or package* to the Register or Coyprights, Copyright Office,
Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20559-6000:

1. A properly completed application form;
2. A nonrefundable filing fee of $20 for each application;
3. A nonreturnable deposit of the work being registered. The deposit
requirements vary in particular situations. The *general* requirements
follow. Also note the information under "Special Deposit Requirements"
immediately following this section.

-> If the work is unpublished, one complete copy or phonorecord.
-> If the work was first published i nthe United States on or after
January 1, 1978, two complete copies or phonorecords of the best
edition.
-> If the work was first published in the United States before January
1, 1978, two complete copies or phonorecords of the work as first
published.
-> If the work was first published outside the United States, one
complete copy or phonorecord of the work as first published."

Also note the section of the special deposit requirements dealing with
software:

"If the work is an unpublished or published computer program, the
deposit requirement is one visually perceptible copy in source code of
the first 25 and last 25 pages of the program. For a program of fewer
than 50 pages, the deposit is a copy of the entire program. (For more
information on computer program registration, including deposits for
revised programs and provisions for trade secrets, request Circular
61.)"

I am not a lawyer, so  be warned... :)
