Hi,

Here is the summary of the current answers (I will change the summary if
others send their answers).

What we essentially agree on
----------------------------

Casting Difficulty Factors                Source TD     Conductor TD

Range                                         Y               Y
  Mike: Unfortunately, this would depend on the spell, for the Conductor side.
  It is more difficult to target a magic arrow at a certain foe at 100 yards
  than it is to effectively drop a TOS fireball or lightningbolt at that
  distance, just due to area of effect.

Guillaume: You still have to target the center of the area of effect for
the fireball and this is more difficult to do with a longer range.

Area of effect                                Y               N

Number of targets                             Y               YY
  Guillaume: More energy required and more control over the direction of the
  energy (with added complexity because the energy needs to be split)

  Del: I think that the source should be cheaper than how much it
  would to cost to cast spells at each. The complexity would be
  greatly increased.

Mass of target(s)                             Y               N
  Del: falls under damage/potency
Speed of induced movement                     Y               N
  Del: falls under damage/potency

Guillaume: these must be factors separate from damage/potency. It should
be harder to move a 100 kg object at 100 m/s than a 1kg object at 100 m/s;
therefore, we cannot join them in the same category. (BTW, I agree with
the Y N for speed of movement)

Control over the movement (maneuverability)   N               Y
Direct application of the Source(s)**         Y               N
Direct application of the Conductor(s)**      N               Y

What needs to be discussed
--------------------------

Casting Difficulty Factors                Source TD     Conductor TD

*****************************************************************************
Del:
Duration                                      Y(N)            Y
I think there are 3 alternatives for duration:

1. Looking at it this way the caster creates a pool of energy that the spell
draws off of? (Thus requiring the extra energy at the beginning).

2. Another way to work duration is to have the caster pay a cost each unit of
time that the spell is going.

3. A third alternative is for them to 'set up' mechanisms for the spell to
maintain itself (requiring a smaller increase in source than the above
2 alternatives). The mechanism would decay and the spell would terminate
depending on how well it was set up.

Mike and Guillaume:
Duration                                      Y               Y
  A longer duration requires more magical energy (Source TD) and a
  greater stability (or dynamic equilibrium) of that energy (Conductor TD)

Guillaume's comment: I think that the way to go is a combination of Del's
mechanisms 1 and 3. Thus my Y Y answer. (2 is too cumbersome during a game)
*****************************************************************************
Del:
Damage done to target(s)                      Y               N
  Focusing is close to how efficiently the caster is using the
  energy that he has gathered, if we are going to use it I would
  rather see it as a separate factor.
Guillaume:
Damage done to target(s)                      Y               Y
  More energy causes more damage, but a more focused use of that
  energy also does
Mike:
Damage done to target(s)                      Y               Y

Guillaume: I can agree with Del's Y N. It essentially means that for a given
type of spell, you only have to pump more energy to do more damage. For 
example, a Fireball with a Source TD of 30 would do more damage than a
Fireball with a Source TD of 20 (the Conductor TD remains the same).
*****************************************************************************
Del:
Difficulty of resisting the spell*            Y               Y
  For physical spells I think this falls again to Potency. For some
  of the celestial conductors Potency is perhaps more dependent on the
  conductor than the source.....
Mike:
Difficulty of resisting the spell*            N               Y
  My initial thought was "N Y", as more source would be better used as
  a hotter fire, etc., so more damage would be dealt regardless of
  resistance.  Charm-type effects don't really need brute force, either.
  Can you think of a spell effect where more power would only affect
  a creature's resistance, but wouldn't hit any harder if it did not
  resist?  Death-spell effects, I suppose, but those would be rediculously
  expensive anyway, if a high-level mage can only be 50% assured of one
  or two kills with a fireball...
Guillaume:
Difficulty of resisting the spell*            Y               Y
  Both the amount of magical energy and its mode of action should
  affect the difficulty of resisting a spell (IMO)

Guillaume: (we'd better stop using the term potency, since we don't seem
to have the same definition for it). I can agree with Mike N Y, but I think
that we first have to define how each type of spell can be resisted. One
of the fundamental questions here is to determine if a magical resistant
creatures could be affected by spells such as a Fireball. 
You can argue both ways:
a) the magic creates fire, which in turn burns the creature. The creature
   is affected indirectly by the Fireball
b) the fire created is magical, so the creature is not affected by it.
We have to chose one option before we go forward. Personnally, I prefer a).
I we choose a), then all spells that damage the target by creating 
external adverse conditions can't be resisted, and the mage does not
have any control over the difficulty of resisting the spell. 
(The adverse conditions might be resisted though)

For spells that directly affect the mind or the body of a being, it is
quite obvious that they can be resisted. For those, I can agree that
more finesse is the key to penetrating the target defenses. Hence I would
go for Mike's N Y.

*****************************************************************************
Per suggests changing "Damage done to target(s)" by "Effect on target(s)" 
since some spells don't cause any damage.

Guillaume: I think that each type of effect will have to be treated 
separately, since you can't quantify a charm in the same manner as damage.
A stronger charm might require both more energy and more craftmanship.
(We will soon end up with a lot of tables for creating spells, but I think
it is the price to pay to avoid having 3rd levels spells like Fireball,
Slow,... that are more powerful than most 4th level spells...)

Please send your own thoughts to see if we can agree on everything.

Guillaume
