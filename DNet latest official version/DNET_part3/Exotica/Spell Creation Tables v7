Well, here it is.

Version 7 of the Spell Creation rules.

All lines that I have changed are preceeded with a "+".  There was a
line
before the System status table that was removed and the table reworked
so
that there is no longer any table from which multiple values are
selected.

I am still not happy with the control over movement table, but I think
that
a discussion of how manuverability of flying creatures will be handled
in
general may be needed first.

I did not change the duration table although that probably still needs
tweeking.

Enjoy!

Introduction
------------

The following tables attempt to provide players with an universal
method
for the computation of the Source and Conductor TDs of their spells.
These
tables apply to mage spells, psionic powers, priest spells, spirit
magic,
etc.

Our goal in creating these tables was to provide a set of guidelines
to
balance the effectiveness of the various types of magical powers that
the characters can develop. We especially wanted to avoid that one
class
of magic users (mages, psionics, priests, ...) become far too powerful
relatively to the others, destroying the balance of the game.

Most of the time, the Source and Conductor task difficulties
calculated
with these tables will be correct. However, it can happen that you
create
a spell with calculated TDs that are either too high or too low. In
this
case, you can always fudge the TD by a few points up or down, with the
game master's permission. If you have to fudge one of the TDs by 5
points
or more, then there is something wrong and you should contact the DNET
team to report your problem.

You are encouraged to submit your spells to us so that we can add them
to the standard spell library. When you submit your spells, list all
the factors that affect the spell difficulty, and provide a good
explanation of why you tweaked the Source and Conductor TD if you had
to resort to this to balance the spell with the standard ones.

The term "magic user" denotes magicians, priests, psionics, shamans,
etc. The term spell refers to the magical effects created by magic
users.

General Principles
------------------

-> The Source TD represents the amount of magical energy required to
   cast the spell successfully. Gathering this energy is tiring and
   the fatigue created by a spell is equal to 1 plus one fifth of the
   the Source TD (rounding up).

-> The Conductor TD represents the complexity of the manipulation
   of the magical energy. Manipulating this energy takes time and
+  the casting time of a spell is equal to 1 plus the Conductor TD,
+  in seconds.

-> Spells that rely on brute for will have a high Source TD.
   Spells that rely on finesse of action will have a high Conductor
TD.

-> Magic always decays if not sustained. This means that any spell
   effect will tend to disappear quickly after the duration of the
   spell. If a magic user creates an object with a spell, this
   object will degrades in seconds after the duration of the spell
   has been expired. In the same manner, if a magic user alters a
   person's memory, that person will recover its previous memories
   after the spell duration. Permanent magical effects can only
   be created with very difficult spells, that must generally be
   combined with rituals and spell components.

-> The magic created by the caster exists only within the spell range.
   No magical effects can manifest outside the spell range. For area
   of effect spells, part of the area can fall outside the range but
   the area center must remain within the range. The spell range is
   always relative to the caster.

Rituals
-------

There will be rules by which you can lower the task difficulties of
spells through an appropriate ritual. Such rituals will also allow
magic users to work collaboratively. Through rituals, magic users will
thus be able to perform spells that are normally too difficult for
them
to cast.

Spells components
-----------------

Spell components that exploit the inherent magical aspect of some
materials or creatures will lower either the Source TD, the Conductor
TD or both. Nothing has been decided on this issue and suggestions
are welcome.

Basic Principles for the Task Difficulties
------------------------------------------

+Each spell is divided into three distinct parts:

1) The infrastructure: determines the base cost of the spell
   Includes: range, duration, precision of area center, directness of
             application of source and conductor, complexity of system
             affected, difficulty of resisting the spell.

2) The effects: everything that is related to the strength of the
spell
                effects
   Includes: hit points healed, damage, mass, speed, maneuverability,
...

3) The extent: the expanse of the spell, in space and time
+  Includes: number of targets (affects both Source TD and Conductor
TD),
             area of effect (affects Source TD),
+            duration (affects both Source TD and Conductor TD).

+These parts are then combined in the following manor to determine the
+Source TD and Conductor TD:
+  Infrastructure + (Effects x Extent)

Spell Creation Template

The following template can be used to ease spell creation.

Base TD
-------

The base Source and Conductor task difficulties is of -10. This
difficulty
will be modified by the various parameters that affect the difficulty
of
the spell. The Source and Conductor TDs are modified independently.

==============
Infrastructure
==============

This section describes all the modifiers to the Source and Conductor
TDs
that are related to the Infrastructure cost of the spell. Apply only
the modifiers that are pertinent to your spell.

Some of these modifiers affect only the Source or Conductor TD, while
others affect both. Each of the modifiers lists which TD is affected.

Range (S&C)
-----

Modifiers the Source and Conductor TDs.

Range is the distance from the caster. No effects of a spell can
manifest
beyond its range.

Rule of thumb: add 5 to the TD modifier each time you quadruple the
range.

258         +20     2.6km
--------------------------

Precision of area center
------------------------

Modifies the Conductor TD.

Only applies to area of effect spells, not spells that target
individual
beings. The Conductor TD is raised as the precision of the targeting
is increased. For example, a weather spell that can tolerate an
imprecision
of 100 meters on its central location will see its Conductor TD
reduced
relatively to another spell which requires a precision of 1 meter on
the center of its effects.

Distance from center indicates the maximum distance at which the
center of
the spell can appear, relatively to the center specified by the mage
during
the casting.

16.1         10        5cm
----------------------------------------------

Complexity of the spell action
------------------------------

Modify both the Source and Conductor TD.

The complexity of a spell depends both on the type of action performed
by the spell and on the complexity of the system the spell affects,
for
spells that alter the internals of a system. To obtain the total spell
complexity, add the action complexity modifier to the system
complexity
modifiers.

------------------------------------------------------------------
TD Modifier       Complexity of the action
------------------------------------------------------------------
     +1           Mild (movement, minor alterations, ...)
     +3           Moderate (healing, damage, teleport, protection,
+                           transformation, ...)
     +5           High (creation, destruction, ...)
------------------------------------------------------------------

+All spells that affect the structure of a system (polymorphing
spells, charm
+spells, creation or destruction spells, healing, ...) must use the
System type
+and System status tables to raise the Source and Conductor TDs.  This
includes
+spells that cause internal damage (such as a reverse of a healing
spell), but
+not spells that cause external damage as the result of an effect
(such as a
+Fireball spell).

The total modifier to TDs is calculated by adding the appropriate
modifiers
>from the two tables below.

---------------------------------------------------------------
+TD modifier     System type (Type of system that can be affected)
---------------------------------------------------------------
   +1           immaterial (energy, fire, ...)
   +2           gases, liquid (or similar)
   +3           uniform solids or force fields, ...
   +4           vegetals, complex solids or force fields, ...
   +5           animal or animated being
   +8           magical or extraplanar entity
---------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------
+TD modifier     System status (What about the system can be affected)
---------------------------------------------------------------
   +0           dead/inanimate
   +1           living/animated
+  +2           Reasoning/Memory only
+  +4           intelligent
+  +8           with soul
---------------------------------------------------------------

Add 5 to this modifier if the spell is an area of effect spell that
targets
the internals of a system, as area effects are not precise by nature
and are
thus not well suited to affect directly the internal structure of
entities.

Difficulty of resisting the spell
---------------------------------

Affects Conductor TD.

If the spells affect directly the target (charm spells, some damage
inducing
spells, ...), then the Conductor TD is modified by the TD of target
resistance
roll.

TD Modifier = Resistance TD      (-5 minimum)

--------------------------------
TD Modifier       Resistance TD
--------------------------------
    -5                -5 or less
    -4                -4
    -3                -3
    -2                -2
    -1                -1
     0                 0
     1                 1
     2                 2
     3                 3
     4                 4
     5                 5
    ...               ...
--------------------------------

+Add +1000 to the TD Modifier if the spell can affect unwilling
targets but
+has no Resistance TD.


Direct application of the Source(s)
-----------------------------------

Modifies the Source TD.

If the effect of the spell is not a direct application of the
source(s),
then the Source TD is raised. Each source that is used in the spell
modifies
the Source TD independently. For example, if a spell uses a collateral
source and a remote source, then its Source TD is modified by a total
of
+15.

Any Source is opposite if there is another Source in the same school
that is more appropriate for the effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TD Modifier       Directness of application (sample spell)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   +0             Direct (Healing with Celestial Power of Daylight)
   +5             Collateral (Any physical effect with Kundalini)
   +10            Remote (Transmuting with Elemental Power of Energy)
   +20            Unrelated (Telekinesis with Elemental Power of
Energy)
   +1000          Opposite (Creation using Elemental Power of Entropy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Direct application of the Conductor(s)
--------------------------------------

Modifies the Conductor TD.

If the effect of the spell is not a direct application of the
conductor(s),
then the Conductor TD is raised. Each conductor that is used in the
spell
modifies the Conductor TD independantly. For example, if a spell uses
a
collateral conductor and a remote conductor, then its Conductor TD is
modified by a total of +15.

Any Conductor is opposite if there is another Conductor in the same
school
that is more appropriate for the effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TD Modifier       Directness of application (sample spell)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   +0             Direct (Fireball with Elemental Fire Focus)
   +5             Collateral (Heating things with Elemental Fire
Focus)
   +10            Remote (Healing with Elemental Water Focus)
   +20            Unrelated (Fireball with Celestial Light Focus)
   +1000          Opposite (Moving things with Celestial Aurora Focus)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

=======
Effects
=======

This section describes all the modifiers to the Source and Conductor
TDs
that are related to the Effects cost of the spell. Apply only the
modifiers
that are pertinent to your spell.

Some of these modifiers affect only the Source or Conductor TD, while
others affect both. Each of the modifiers lists which TD is affected.

Intensity of the effects
------------------------

Can modify either the Source TD, the Conductor TD or both.

This is a general table that modifiers both the Source TD and
Conductor TD
depending on the strength of the effects created by the spell. Do not
use
this table if your spell is oriented toward: Damage, Healing, [Mind
Control],
... There exists tables for those particular effects that are a better
guide
than this general Intensity table.

------------------------------------------
TD Modifier       Intensity of the effects
------------------------------------------
     +2           Mild
     +5           Moderate
    +10           High
    +15           Overwhelming
------------------------------------------

Intensity: Hit Points healed
----------------------------

Modifies the Source and Conductor TDs.

For healing spells, the TD is also modified by the number of hit
points
healed.

   ...                  ...
-------------------------------------

Intensity: Damage done to target(s)
-----------------------------------

Modifies the Source TD.
If the spell causes damage, then its Source TD is modified by the
table below.

A spell that causes damage only through secondary effects (by making
the
ceiling fall, for example) does not see its Source TD modified by the
table
below. In general, if the main purpose of a spell is to cause damage,
then
their Source TD should be affected by how much damage it causes.

--------------------------------
TD Modifier       Average Damage
--------------------------------
   +1                  2 (1d3)
   +2                  4 (1d6)

--------------------------------

+Intensity: Mass per target, Speed of induced movement

Modifies the Source TD.
+Mass is per target (Area of effect spells that are dependant
+on mass count as a single target).
+Speed is meters per round.

------------------------------------

Intensity: Control over the movement (maneuverability)
------------------------------------------------------

Modifies the Conductor TD.

For spells that create movement, the Conductor TD is modified by the
maneuverability of the movement.

---------------------------------------------
TD modifier     Turn rate (in any direction)
---------------------------------------------
    +0          Bad (45 degrees/round)
    +2          Fair (90 degrees/round)
    +5          Good (180 degrees/round)
    +7          High (360 degrees/round)
   +10          Excellent (720 degrees/round)
---------------------------------------------

+Add 10 to this modifier if the target controls the movement (as
opposed to
+the mage).

======
Extent
======

This section describes all the modifiers to the Source and Conductor
TDs
that are related to the Extent cost of the spell. Apply only the
modifiers
that are pertinent to your spell.

Some of these modifiers affect only the Source or Conductor TD, while
others affect both. Each of the modifiers lists which TD is affected.

Note that the Extent modifiers multiply the Effects modifiers!

Area of Effect
--------------

Modifies the Source TD.

--------------------------------------------
Effects TD       Sphere         Cubes
Multiplier      (radius)    (5x5x5 meters^3)
--------------------------------------------
  x1             <= 3m           1
  x1.5           <= 5m           2
  x2             <= 10m          4
  x2.5           <= 15m          6
  x3             <= 25m          10
  x4             <= 45m          15
  x5             <= 70m          25
  x6             <= 100m         35
  x7             <= 135m         50
--------------------------------------------
[Radius = (5/3*Multiplier)^2; rounded to nearest nice value]
[Cubes = Multiplier^2 (rounded to a nice value)]

[Do we want cubical area of effects?]

Number of Targets
-----------------

Modifies the Source and Conductor TDs.

If the spell specifies a number of targets, then it should not specify
an
area of effect. The only limitation is that all targets should be
within
range.

---------------------
Effects TD   Number of
Multiplier    Targets
---------------------
   x1           1
   x2           2
   x3           4
   x4           8
   x5          16
   x6          32
   x7          64
   x8         128
---------------------

Duration
--------

Modifies the Source and Conductor TDs.

The duration multiplier depends on the complexity of the spell action.
The more complex a spell, the shorter it is.

If a spell causes damage directly, i.e. not through the manipulation
of
some physical object, then its complexity is considered to be 20+ for
the
calculation of the duration multiplier.
