DragonNet FAQ

1. What is DragonNet?

     DragonNet (abbreviated DNET) is a group effort to create a
fantasy-oriented role-playing system, but DNET may be amended in the future to
encompass other genres.


2. What is the DragonNet system?

     The DragonNet system is still taking shape.  But it will be a hybrid
system that takes advantage of occupation-oriented systems and skill-based
systems.  DragonNet will have elements of both.  DragonNet is intended to be
simple to learn, but also to be rich and complex enough to be enjoyed by
experienced gamers of all ages.  Specific aspects of the DragonNet system will
be posted on rec.games.design for discussion by the Net gaming design
community, although any actual revision to the game system will be done via
the mailing lists (see question 6 below).  As always, we welcome any
constructive comments.


3. Why DragonNet?

     Recently, certain companies have taken a very unfriendly stance to the
traditional openness and sharing of the InterNet (at least the openness and
sharing that was present before the introduction of certain legislation, but
we won't go into that here).  Certain companies have made the atmosphere in
certain InterNet newsgroups very unfriendly, and have actively discouraged
creativity.  A few people found these practices distasteful enough, that we
banded together and determined to create a new system, free from entangling
alliances with certain large corporations and their rabid legal departments. 
DragonNet is the fruit of that determination.


4. Is DragonNet compatible with other gaming systems?

     DragonNet is intended to be an independent and self-sufficient gaming
system.  It is not intended to be compatible with other gaming systems.  We
may develop conversions for popular gaming systems at some point in the
future.


5. Is DragonNet Public Domain?

     DragonNet is NOT Public Domain (PD).  The authors of this project do not
wish to see it co-opted by the unethical or greedy.  However, DragonNet will
be freely available to the InterNet community and distributable in its
complete form.  DragonNet has adopted a licensing system so that the integrity
of the game can be assured.


6. What is the organization of the DragonNet group?

     The DragonNet effort is divided up into teams working on specific aspects
of the DNET system. Each team is lead by a team leader who coordinates the
team's input and keeps the group and the organizational leader informed of
progress.  The names of the groups and other important people, along with

8. What are the goals of the DragonNet teams?

Many of the goals listed below have been met to date.  A number of others have
yet to be completed.

     CORE
(Skills, Combat, Core Mechanics) Core Mechanics will express the basic
operation of the game.  It will determine how skills and abilities are
expressed. This group is not responsible for producing the actual skills,
spells, or abilities.  Skills will develop the skills that are to be used in
the system.  The list will be relatively complete, and should cover everything
from crafts (silversmithing, farming, carpentry) to adventuring skills like
lock picking.  Combat will produce the rules for combat resolution.  This
includes rules and skills for both armor and weapon use.  This team will also
produce a list of weapons and armor.

     EXOTICA
     (Magic, Psionics)
Psionics will produce the psionics system.  The goal is to produce a system
compatible with the Magic system.  The magic Spells team has two goals.  The
first is to produce a unique, general magic system. The second is to produce a
list of magic spells.  The magic system will point-based to allow more
flexibility and creativity.  The Magic Items team will create a large listing
of magic items for the DragonNet system.  Items should range from wimpy to
powerful, from normal to clever to strange.  This team will also provide rules
for item creation.

     GAME WORLDS
The Worlds group is responsible for producing a game setting(s) for use with
the DragonNet system.  These worlds will be rich enough in detail that they
can be played in any campaign with as little or as much preparation by the
individual GM as desired.  The Worlds group is also responsible for collecting
resources which can be useful to any campaign setting.

     PUBLICATIONS
     (Includes Editing, Artwork, and Software)
Editing will ensure that the materials produced by other teams is
understandable and internally consistent.  Publications will make the
DragonNet system available through ftp, WWW, as well as by paper. 
Publications will also make future supplements to the DragonNet system
available to users.  Artwork will be providing illustrations for important
aspects of the game, as well as background art for published materials. 
Character races will definitely be included, and monsters as time permits. 
Artwork will available in a variety of digital formats for the convenience of
DragonNet users.  Software will write and compile code for DragonNet
utilities, such as character generators.
