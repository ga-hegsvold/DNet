Description:    
	Bats tend to avoid human contact.  If frightened large groups can 
 confuse and blind a party as they swarm.  Bats are usually 
 nocturnal, though it is not totally uncommon to see them during 
 daylight.  They are very maneuverable in flight and can negotiate 
 360 degree turns in one and one-half their body length.
	Large groups of bats will swarm if excited by loud or high-pitched 
 sound.  If bats should swarm, a save must be made if carrying any 
 object in hand (TD: -3) for each round of the swarm.
 If the save fails, the object will be dropped. In addition a save 
 vs. disorientation must be made as well (TD: 2), if this should 
 occur movement is impossible in a known direction.

Description:    
	 Bookworms are an inchworm like with the ability to change color to 
 match their surroundings.  They are drawn to parchment and can eat 
 their own weight in about 5 minutes expelling a fine powder as 
 waste. A bookworm can crawl on a person without detection and smell 
 parchment up to 100 m away.  Bookworms tend to live indoors, however 
 they can sustain them selves outdoors in warm climates if a wood 
 source is near.
	Bookworms can destroy an average piece of parchment in about an 
 hour, for this reason they are hated by spell casters and the legal 
 profession.  Temperatures near freezing will cause the bookworm to 
 hibernate, after which they are ravenous and will double their 
 eating.

 gold or copper coins.  These creatures usually dwell in damp wooden 
 chests and lie with the coins.  They move slowly when walking, 
 however they can jump about 2m swiftly. This usually occurs when 
 they smell warm-blooded food.  The Coincrit will then burrow beneath 
 the victims flesh and ooze a sleep inducing poison.  The victim will 
 then remain asleep while the Coincrit feeds upon its body fluids.  
 Coincrits are easily destroyed by extreme heat or cold, however this 
 will usually harm the victim as well and could cause scaring. Sleep 
 Poison; TD=6, TD=7 (+1 per hour asleep).  Feeding inflicts 6 injury 
 points per Coincrit per hour.

Description:
	Dryads are members of the Faerie.  They are extreme beautiful 
 women.  Due to the special magic of Dryads, any daughters they have 
 are fully Dryads, and any sons they have are fully the race of the 
 father.  They tend to be shy and avoid contact with others.  They 
 are nonviolent and pleasant to be with.  If a person meets a Dryad, 
 and is kind and amicable to them, they enjoy quiet conversation.  
 They have an affinity to a specific Oak tree to which they bind 
 themselves.  They have the ability to Charm Person at will, with a 
 highly effective spell that has a save at TD:6 on the victims.  They 
 can enter and leave trees at will.  Dryads have the ability to 
 Dimension Door to their special Oak tree once they enter any oak 
 tree.  They have such a strong empathy with plants that they can 
 actually speak with them with concentration.  They cannot wear armor 
 due to their nature and will only wear loose clothing if any.  They 
 speak the languages of Faerie and the local dominant woodland 
 species.  Since the language of Faerie is based solely on an Oral 
 Tradition, there is no written form for them to know.

	When they are adults looking for a mate, they find themselves 
 easily enamored of highly charismatic individuals whom they will try 
 to charm.  After 2 years, the male will become immune to the spell, 
 but if he has learned to love her in this time, he will stay of his 
 own free will.  If not, when he departs, he leaves the Dryad 
 heartbroken.  She will withdraw from contact with anyone save any 
 daughter they had.  If they had sons, she will send them with the 
 father.  If he refuses them, she will raise them until they can be 
 separated from her and give them to the community of Faerie.  
 Daughters are held in special regard (and dealt with below as PCS).  
 If she is alone, she will revert to her normal patterns and again 
 seek a mate.

	Daughters are held in great love by their Dryad mothers.  These are 
 the only types of Dryad allowed to be PC's from age 100 till they 
 find their tree.  They are raised by their mothers until they are 
 100 years old and are dependent on them for their link to nature. 
 Daughters use their mother's Oak tree the same as mothers do.  
 During this time, their magic resistance grows slowly, 10% every 20 
 years until they reach their 50% after 100 years.  At 100 years of 
 age, they are fully developed in the physical sense and old enough 
 to start the quest for their own Oak, but are about the equivalent 
 maturity of a 13-15 year old human.  They are not fully matured 
 until about 150 years of age.  Their charm ability doesn't manifest 
 itself until they are 100 years old, and then it is not fully 
 developed until they find their own tree.  They can Charm Person one 
 time a day, at TD:2 on  the victim.  Until a Dryad has found her 
 special Oak tree, she cannot Dimension Door, but can still enter and 
 leave trees.  Her tie to plants is there, but not as developed.  So, 
 she has plant empathy that she can use at will, but can speak with 
 plants only once per day and only with at least 10 minutes of 
 uninterrupted concentration.

	Once her daughter reaches 99 years old, a Dryad's mother will spend 
 the next year having her tree make a special staff for her daughter. 
 This staff serves as the surrogate tree for the young Dryad until 
 she can find her special Oak. She can enter and leave the staff  at 
 will.  She can sense it if it is within 10 miles of her.  If she is 
 separated from it, she starts to fade and get sick.  At that point 
 she starts to lose one Body point per day until she recovers it or 
 finds an Oak tree will let her enter it.  If this tree is not her 
 special tree, then she will not be able to recover the lost Body 
 points until she finds either her staff.  If her staff is recovered 
 for her, and brought in contact with this tree, she can be released 
 from the temporary Oak and again take up her quest to find her 
 special tree.  This staff is magic and has the special strength and 
 resistance to magic as its owner. Any non-magic damage done to the 
 staff may be absorbed by the dryad to save her staff as she is so 
 connected to it.  It should be commented that when the Dryad starts 
 her quest for her tree, the tree may not exist yet.  But she 
 wouldn't know, she just needs to search for it.  If she sits in 
 concentration and meditation (with breaks for sleep and meals only), 
 she gets a percent chance equal to the number of days spent 
 concentrating to detect the direction to her special tree, if it 
 exists.

	Dryads tend to wander around a large area seeking their tree. They 
 have a TD:10 of finding their special tree per year -1 for every 10 
 years of searching. This is usually when they are most likely to be 
 seen by humans and many of the rumors and legends of Dryads come 
 from these chance encounters.  They sometimes find themselves lost 
 while searching, and will pretend to be Elvish women if they need to 
 approach anyone for help.  True Elvish women have a TD:3 plus 
 intelligence to tell that there is something peculiar about them 
 though, and have a TD:0 if they actually decide to concentrate on 
 trying to figure it out.  Until they find their special tree, they 
 do not suffer the overwhelming attraction to highly charismatic men, 
 but they still feel strongly when they meet them.  They will not 
 mate until they have their own tree and have fully developed their 
 powers.

	Being a member of the Faerie community, Dryads cannot touch 
 anything that contains iron.  Dryads will use weapons like staff, 
 flint or obsidian daggers, or special magical weapons that have no 
 iron or steel (like mithril or special gold or silver alloys).  
 Also, armor is restricted to being without any iron and loose 
 fitting. Since they are so attuned to the woods and outdoors, they 
 are claustrophobic and hate the indoors and city areas.  If a PC 
 Dryad wants to be able to speak Common, they have to learn it as a 
 skill.        

	Those Dryads that learn magic will find themselves strong in 
 abilities that are associated with charming, but will not cast 
 spells that harm nature. Their plant bound nature is such that they 
 will not have anything to do with them. That doesn't stop a Dryad 
 from using illusions though.  Plant associated spells they will find 
 have -2 added to their TD. Spells associated with metals are more 
 difficult for Dryads, so they have +2 added to their TD.

Description:
	Dwarves are sturdy humanoid creatures that live in hills or  
 mountains.  They have tan skin with black hair, ruddy cheeks and  
 bright eyes.  Dwarves are short, stocky, and have a muscular build, 
 Occasionally with a pot belly. Almost all Dwarves have beards  
 including females, the length of a Dwarf's beard is a status symbol. 
 They love the underground and any thing associated with it.  
 Dwarves  are excellent miners and are proficient underground 
 engineers.  Dwarves' have good night vision and their infrared 
 vision extends to a range of 30 m. A dwarf's hardy nature provides a 
 +1 bonus to resist the effects of poison.  As elves are keepers of 
 the forest, dwarves are the keeps of the underworld. 

	Some people say that the dwarfs' temperament is that of a mountain; 
 proud, hard working, unswerving in their goals and true to their  
 promises (claimed or unheard), the dwarves often appear to be of the 
 same essence as the mountains they inhabit.  If they are unswerving 
 in their beliefs, the dwarves are also reluctant to accept changes; 
 hence, in many mountainous regions, the proverb "stubborn as a  
 dwarf" has replaced "stubborn as a mule." In those same regions, one 
 often says of a noisy person that he or she is "as silent as a  
 dwarven scout," referring to their natural clumsiness and their 
 well-known tastes for heavy armors.  Of course, these comparisons, 
 are  uncontested by the dwarves themselves, who often speak or joke 
 of it. 

	Contrarily to the popular belief, the dwarves do not shun water and 
 most of them know the basics of swimming. They do, however, have  
 little love for  the sea, but this comes more from the unobstructed  
 view it offers than from a fear of water. This agoraphobia, which is 
 shared by most dwarves, manifests itself in areas where there is  
 nothing to block the sight before it reaches the horizon. It is less 
 pronounced in plains than on the seas, as dwarves tend to be more  
 secure when they can feel the earth beneath their feet.

	While dwarves do not deliberately seek war, many of them hold the  
 opinion that a good battle can solve a lot of problems, especially  
 if Orcs or goblins are involved. In battle, they prefer the axe to 
 the sword, and the heavier metal armor to the leather ones. Of  the 
 latter, they often say that you cannot rely on a hide which  did not 
 protect the animal who wore it first . . . 

	Children are typically born one at a time, and most of the time the 
 child is a male. Because of their lesser numbers, in most dwarven 
 cultures women have great influence.

	Dwarves officially reach maturity at the age of 25, but only marry  
 around the age of 50, if they ever do. A dwarven family is generally 
 formed of the two parents and four to six children; it is common  
 for an unmarried uncle to also live with the family.

Description:
	 Elves have a strange beauty that Humans consider exotic and 
 appealing. They tend to be of a lighter coloring between the 
 Nobility and members of Enclave societies, but seem to follow no 
 rule among the wandering clans whose members have the whole spectrum 
 of skin, hair, and eye coloring. All Elves have pointed ears, slim 
 eye borrows, almond shaped eyes, and full lips. Most tend to be 
 slender of build but about one in 50 may be plump.  Because of the 
 great age that elves can reach, they tend to have a life view that 
 takes very long and patient methods into account.  They have a 
 fascination with magic and all elves know at least a bit about it 
 due to the fact that it is so widely used in their societies. Even 
 if they cannot exercise magic most elves have been exposed to it by 
 an early age.  An elf is generally considered immature before 50 and 
 mature after 100.  In between it depends on the individual.

 attack fiercely if hungry and prefer smaller prey.  Groups have been 
 known to strangle small horses and then ripe parts off to digest. A 
 single jump can cover 15 m. Their green camouflage makes them 
 difficult to notice in large vegetation. (TD=5).  Giant frogs have a

Description:
	Ghouls are creatures that consume the flesh of the dead to sustain 
 their  undead' lives indefinitely, this however causes an insanity 
 and deformity.  They slowly start to lose their appearance and turn 
 into creatures with gray rotting flesh, fangs no body hair and flesh 
 less limbs. They emit a foul smell that can be noticed from 30 m 
 away.  They hate all living creatures as their Envy of life turns to 
 insanity, and will kill on sight any creature. It is believed they 
 where first formed from a holy man's curse placed on a man who ate 
 the flesh of his dead family. Any mammal with near human INT that 
 eats Ghoul flesh will die and become a Ghoul. (If culture believes, 
 cannabism is wrong.) Humanoids eating ghoul flesh are usually 
 insane, starving, or forced to do so by curtain cults that use 
 Ghouls to guard sacred places. This has started the practice of 
 burning their corpse. Ghouls are very strong about twice their 
 original strength and feel no pain. They will fight until destroyed 
 without becoming unconscious.  Ghouls have an intense fear of Holy 
 objects from deities that represent life.

	Hausguests live solitary lives, however between the ages of 20 and 
 50 they will mate once every 5 years.  This usually produces 1 or 2 
 young which the mother will raise for 3 to 4 years.  The Hausguest 
 is an indoor cousin of the sprite.  This creature abhors filth and 
 will be constantly cleaning.  This is always done when others cannot 
 observe them or their work.  The Cottage Sprite dwells in solitary 
 places of  man made' construction, preferring more moderate 
 climates.  They are very fast and can fly.  The Houseguest feels it 
 is its task in life to keep its home well kept, tidy and clean.  
 When the Hausguest reaches maturity (50 years) it selects a place as 
 its home and will spend the rest of its life there or until its home 
 is destroyed.  Hausguests come in all shades of brown from straw to 
 near black, it is humanoid in shape except for very long digits, 
 wings, bumpy skin, and shiny yellow cat like eyes.
	The Hausguest will never actively harm any living thing, even when 
 attacked it will turn invisible and fly away.  However, they can 
 become a pain as they tidy up as they see fit.   Hey, how did my 
 shield get in the closet?',  Who put my daggers in the cupboard?',  
 Where did my spell book go?'.

Description:
	Humans are the most adaptive and diverse of the intelligent 
 species. Humans come in all shapes, sizes and colors. Due to their 
 adaptive nature, humans have the ability to generalize their skills. 
 That is they can choose any combination of skills. Their 
 adaptiveness also leads to many varying cultures.

	The most common human culture is that of the civilized world. When 
 referring to civilization, and humans in general, it is this culture 
 that is referred to. The civilized world is wherever humans have 
 congregated in large numbers to pursue a  modern way of life'. This 
 includes kingdoms, cities, towns, etc. as well as the areas that lay 
 on the outskirts of the civilized world commonly known as the 
 frontier.

Sub Culture(s): as per Lycanthrope species


Description:
	Only mammals may be affected by Lycanthropy and the Lycanthrope 
 species must be a mammal.  This also means a mammal may have 
 lycanthropy into a more humanoid form.

	Although not strictly a separate species, there is a genetic 
 susceptibility that makes manifestation of lycanthropy possible. The 
 above characteristics are not absolute, rather they are 
 modifications of the being's attributes when afflicted with the 
 disease. The disease is not an all or nothing deal, a person can be 
 affected to varying degrees at various times. For simplicity most 
 GMs will probably only want to consider 3 states. Normal being, 
 half-Lycanthrope, full-Lycanthrope. A check should be made for the 
 being 4 times a month; once at each half moon, two days before the 
 new moon, and two days before the full moon.

	The lycanthropy disease is found at (to be done later). The 
 following modifiers are applied to the virulence during the check. A 
 failed check moves the character into a more Lycanthrope state, a 
 successful check moves the character toward a more normal state.
 current state lycanthrope     (+1)
 current state normal        (-1)
 new moon          (-5)
 full moon         (+5)
 immersion in original culture        (-1 to -5)
 immersion in lycanthrope species-setting
 or proximity to that species.     (+1 to +5)

Modifiers can be used based on the character's will power and game 
 optional control skills.

Affects:
	For the normal being state, the modifiers to the character are 
 least. About the only difference is an affinity for the lycanthrope 
 species.

	For the half-lycanthrope state, the attribute modifiers are taken 
 into account. The character has stronger instincts and urges. These 
 may not be apparent to the character, but the character will try to 
 rationalize these urges into their actions. There will also be some 
 physical manifestations (e.g., increased hair coverage, eye 
 shape/color, longer nails, modified ears, etc.). The character will 
 also have instincts for the social nature of the Lycanthrope 
 species.

	In the full Lycanthrope state, the character actually changes into 
 that species. The lycanthrope may not remember details of the 
 character's life, but it will to some degree understand strong 
 emotions about people, places and things. In other respects they 
 will be the lycanthrope species.

NPC:
	Depending on the plans of the GM, a character who becomes infected 
 with lycanthropy may become an NPC either temporarily or permanently 
 or not at all. The GM will make this clear when the condition has 
 been identified.  Some possible times this can occur are when the 
 character becomes either half or full lycanthrope. If  the 
 lycanthrope remains a PC the player can make a willpower check. In 
 the case of strong emotions it will determine if  they can make a 
 decision that is not consistent with its current state, but is 
 consistent with its untransformed state.

Transformation:
	The transformation is because of the magical disease, but the 
 process is not quick or automatic. Generally transformation from one 
 state to another takes several days. Going into more 
 lycanthrope-like states the being will generally change mass and 
 size. Likewise going into more normal states, the being will need to 
 change mass. This will cause the character be very hungry during 
 these period of time. There do exist more magical versions of the 
 disease which allow the transformation to occur more quickly and 
 without any sever mass changes.

	If the GM allows some control over the transformation, then if the 
 check is successful, but would have failed without WIL and skill 
 modifiers then the being retains their consciousness in the more 
 animal like forms (no INT -3) and can choose the direction of the 
 transformation.

Contagiousness:
	Lycanthropy can be spread by the sharing of bodily fluids. Beings 
 can be especially susceptible to it giving a +1 to +15 to the 
 virulence. For details of the disease see the description of 
 lycanthropy.

Description:
	Weejon is descendant of the elven line but is much smaller than 
 elves.  They have long straight brown hair which is just a shade 
 lighter than their skin tone.  Most Weejons do not cut their hair.  
 Like their cousins the elves, their eyes are almond shaped and their 
 ears are pointed.  One difference, is that a Weejon's eyes change 
 color based on their mood. Some are:
		 Red     - Angry, Threatened     Blue      - Sad, Mournful     
		 Yellow - Scared, Worrisome
		 Green  - Mischievous               Brown  - Normal
 There is a common phrase "More angry than a red-eyed Weejon."  When 
 a Weejon passes away, its eyes turn white except for the pupils.  
 They are lithe and graceful like their elven cousins.
 
	Due to their small stature, they are not very strong beings. They 
 are, however, very agile.  Weejon can move incredibly fast through 
 any terrain and are excellent climbers.
 
	In general, the Weejon is a very joyous race.  They enjoy dancing 
 and singing and have large festivals with each change of a season.  
 Weejons are also incorrigible pranksters.  They love to play jokes 
 on unwary  travelers passing by or camping in the vicinity of their 
 woodlands.
 
	The Weejons can be compared to the wolverine: small but fierce. 
 Weejons are very brave and fight with a ferocity belied by their 
 size.  Since they are so small, the weapons they use are also small. 
 Generally, they choose bows, blowguns, small spears, and 
 mini-crossbows.  When in close combat, they will wield two daggers, 
 with one half again the size of the other.  If they use a short 
 sword, it is treated as a two-handed weapon.
 
	For protection, they have three innate abilities.  The first is the 
 ability to blink to any visible area within a 20 m radius.  They 
 cannot blink through objects.  Each time they blink it takes a 
 physical toll on the body and they must rest if they blink too much. 
 As one point of fatigue per blink.  Their second ability is to blend 
 in with nature rendering them virtually invisible to non-Weejons.  
 Elves have a 20% better chance to spot them if they are specifically 
 looking.  This only works within natural areas full of plants, 
 bushes and trees.  They do not blend in with rocks!  The third is 
 the night vision shared with their cousins the elves.
 
	Weejons represent a small portion of the populace of the known 
 world. After mating, the mother and father pass a portion of their 
 life force, 50 years, onto their child.  Do to this fact Weejon 
 children  remember' some of the parent's life before their birth.  
 Each Weejon can mate three times before passing to the realm beyond. 
 Weejons share the long Lifespan of the elves, unless they mate.

	They are born in the forest and are raised until the age of five.  
 It is at this age that they are bonded with an animal.  The parents 
 (GM) decide what type of animal and place the child with the young 
 of that species.  Usually the bonded animal is the offspring of a 
 previously bonded animal. Once grown, the animal and the Weejon can 
 speak their thoughts telepathically.

Description:
	Wolves are predatory wild dogs, with long light brown to dark gray 
 hair, large fangs, and have ravenous appetites.  They tend to live 
 in moderate to cold climates and are usually found in packs, however 
 solitary wolves are not totally uncommon.  They fear fire and will 
 not come within 20 m of it.   A wolf's howl can strike fire into 
 most herbivores, and horses are one of their favorite prey.

	Wolves hunt in packs of 5-20 and if hungry will fiercely attack 
 anything the group can kill.  Some packs have been known to have a 
 taste for domestic animals and will go out of their way to kill 
 them, this has caused many herd owners to actively hunt wolves.

Description:
	Worbs are small humanoid bandits of low intellect that will fight 
 without regard to safety.
 Worbs make any small primitive weapons, such as spears and clubs but 
 recognize the worth of any small weapon they find.   They tend to be 
 fond of smaller cutting weapons like daggers, small axes and some 
 will use short swords if they can find them.   Believed to be once 
 human these creatures never evolved or devolved into something more 
 an animal than human.  Worbs are pale skinned, fanged, with dark 
 patchy hair on their face and head and have stumpy limbs.  Worbs 
 have little use for clothing and believe it is ridiculous. They have 
 no known language and  communicate' in a grunt form. They have a 
 fear of fire and will not come within 10 m of it.  Worbs are fond of 
 shiny objects like coins or gems.  A good description of the bands 
 is wolf like packs that hunt prey as food or a source of wealth. 
 (Any shiny object is wealth to a Worb.)

Description:    
	Wormcorpse are not undead in and of themselves rather the worms 
 that feed on them are.  The spirits of the unfaithful are 
 transformed into worms and are punished by being forced to  exist' 
 on the life force of others.  The Wormcorpse is animated by these 
 worms to seek new feeding grounds.  The touch of a Wormcorpse may 
 cause fear (TD:7) or flee or 10 rounds.  An attack score (- defense 
 score) of greater then nine means a worm has attached to a victim. 
 The victim must then stop and remove the worm and burn it or cover 
 with holy water. (Cutting makes 2 worms). If not immediately removed 
 each 6 seconds after the victim must save (TD:10 - PSY) or become 
 mindless and let to worm into a body opening. Once this happens the 
 victim will lose life force (1 year / minute) until dead and become 
 a Wormcorpse. One worm must remain in the corpse to keep it animated 
 burring a Wormcorpse will cause all worms to flee. A Wormcorpse will 
 have a Body score of the original species plus one point per worm in 
 the corpse.

Description:
	This kind of zombie is made by the pure use of magical energy.  
 Magical created zombies are truly mindless because the Mage creating 
 this zombies can use any corps that is in good condition. This means 
 that the orders given to such a zombie have to be more precise. A 
 regular use of magic is necessary to maintain such a zombie's 
 existence.

	In combat they are very slow and ineffective. Although they are a 
 little bit stronger than an average member of the zombie's former 
 race, they have not enough willpower left to fight. Their way to 
 fighting is more a monotone hack-and-slay than a combination of 
 attacking and parrying. Zombies are strong and willing workers and 
 are seldom used as guards. But in times of war they are also used to 
 frighten the enemy.

Description:
	These are the first undead created by Demenateez. They are "simply" 
 the animated corpses of dead beings from all of the known races. 
 Their flesh is rotting very fast and sometimes an observer can see 
 pieces of flesh falling off. But it seems that their body will never 
 be clear of it.

	Zombies are a reward from the priests of Demenateez for the 
 sacrifice of a soul that suffers and feels fear. While drinking the 
 sacrificed one's essence (Life Force) and feeling the poor souls 
 pain in his last seconds, Demenateez lets a little of essence remain 
 in the body and it becomes a zombie. This zombie will obey the 
 commands of the priest or undead who did the sacrifice. Any creature 
 that is defined as "living" can be zombified. The only problem may 
 be that you have to let it stay immobile before the altar during the 
 zombification.

	While immune to pain, fear and mind affecting spells, zombies can 
 be destroyed by physical attacks (either by weapons or magic). If 
 this happens, the zombie's body will rot to dust within 1 hour. 
 After this time the rest of the soul trapped in the body will be 
 freed and the body is useless for reanimation.

	This kind of zombie does not need any kind of air to stay alive. 
 Their only problem is a constant need of fresh meat - preferably 
 torn out of a living body. This is one of the reasons why 
 Demenateeze's followers haven't created armies of thousands of 
 zombies.

	-optional
	1.1 Zombie Priest
	Priests of Demenateez may have the chance to receive a very special 
 gift from their god: Zombification as an independent creature. They 
 offer the most part of their essence and gain the zombification. 
 These zombies have their own mind and will. All of their other 
 attributes are like a True zombie's.

Description:
	Shamans and other priest that do not worship Demenateez are trying 
 to imitate the creation of zombies. They also "create" zombies in a 
 ritual. But the effect of zombification is the result of a toxin 
 secretly injected before the ritual. This toxin affects parts of the 
 victim's brain and nervous system. Some intoxicated are dying before 
 the ritual and some resist the effect of the toxin. 

	Voodoo zombies are no kind of undead. They are in fact living 
 creatures unable to make their own decisions. They continue their 
 life in a mindless way and are more active than other kinds of 
 zombies. This zombification is curable. A priest knowing the formula 
 of the toxin can attempt to make an antidote.

	Voodoo zombies have the same immunities than other zombies but they 
 need breathable air and normal food to stay alive. 

-optional
	If a voodoo zombie bites an opponent, there is a minimal chance 
 that a certain amount (1 milliliter) of the toxin is injected in his 
 veins and changes the opponent to a zombie. More hits in a short 
 time will increase this chance.

The poison used to create voodoo zombies is called Voodoo Juice:

Name:   Voodoo Juice
Virulence:  1 per milliliter up to a max of 10
Onset:  3-5 hours
Transmission: Ingestion / Injection
Resistance:     TD:9
Effect:   Voodoo Zombism for 2-10 (2d5) weeks, death if afflicted 
 more than 3 times
Antidote:   Yes,  Adrenal Glands of Jungle Apes
