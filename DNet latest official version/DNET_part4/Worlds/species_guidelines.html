<h3>1. Deciding the general idea of the species</h3>
If you decide to create a new species then you normally have
an idea of how the species will look like and what are its
special characteristics (i.e. attributes, abilities, ...).
If not, try to visualize a general picture of the species 
and which role it will play in your world.
</a>

<p>
<h3>2. Can a PC be from this species?</h3>
If you want to create a new race for players then you need to
calculate the EP cost.This is the number of points that must be
spent to choose this species as a player character's race.
Even if you create only a new monster then it will be a good way
to measure the strength of the species. Everything that gives the
new species some sort of power will raise the EP cost. And everything
disadvantageous to it will lower it. Balanced advantages and 
disadvantages will keep the cost near 0.
</a>

<p>
<h3>3. Height, weight and lifespan</h3>

You then have to define the average
<ul>
  <li> height in m,
  <li> weight in kg and
  <li> lifespan in years. 
</ul>
According to this you can also see which <b>Size rating</b> the species
has. This is an additional value that will be used in combat. Humans have 
a size rating of 0.

<h4>Size Rating</h4>

You can determine the Size Rating (SR) of your species from the 
<b>Strength and Size Rating Table</b> given below. Find the average
height of your species in the Humanoid Height column and note the 
corresponding SR. Note that this SR is valid if your species has the same 
proportions as a human, i.e. if it has the same ratio as a human between 
height and width. If the species is larger for its height than a human, 
raise its SR value by 1. If it is slimmer, lower its SR by 1.

<h4>Strength and Size Rating Table</h4>

The following table can be used to determine a number of factors relating 
to a creatures size and strength.

<pre>

<h3>4. Adjusting attributes / speed</h3>
The steps above will tell you in which way you may change the Talents of the
species. The average attributes of a human are all 0 and ranges normally from
-5 to +5. When you adjust a Talent, you decide how much it will differ from
the human standard. You do this by adding or subtracting a specific value.
<p>
<code>
For example:<br>
The new species is taller and lighter than a human but more flexible
and agile. This could mean:<br>
Talents modifiers: AGI +1, FIT -1, STR -1<br><br>
The resulting EP cost would be -10. This could offset the cost of another
advantage.
</code>
<p>
<b>The Talents are:</b>
<table border>
  <tr><td align="middle" colspan=3><b>Physical</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>AGI</td><td>Agility</td><td>Body control; balance; rythm; flexibility</td></tr>
  <tr><td>BEA</td><td>Beauty</td><td>How nice you <em>look</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td>DEX</td><td>Manual Dexterity</td><td>Hand-eye coordination; fine motricity of the arms and hands; sensivity to touch</td></tr>
  <tr><td>FIT</td><td>Fitness</td><td>Bodily health; resistance to hardship, injury or disease</td></tr>
  <tr><td>STR</td><td>Strength</td><td>Rating of Physical power for short and prolonged use</td></tr>
  <tr><td align="middle" colspan=3><b>Mental</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>AUR</td><td>Aura</td><td>Non-tangible complement to beauty; charisma</td></tr>
  <tr><td>INT</td><td>Intelligence</td><td>Memory; analytical and reasoning ability; speed of thought</td></tr>
  <tr><td>PER</td><td>Perception</td><td>Includes alertness and observational acuity</td></tr>
  <tr><td>PSY</td><td>Psyche</td><td>Creativity, Intuition, affinity to the natural and supernatural</td></tr>
  <tr><td>WIL</td><td>Willpower</td><td>Self discipline and mental fortitude (i.e. mental fitness)</td></tr>
</table>
For a detailed description of the attributes please refer to the character
creation guide in the rules.

<p>
<b>Base Speed:</b>
This is not an attribute but results directly from them. Decide which speed is
a logical result from its Talents and the species size. The base speed is
normally given in both meters/round and km/h. To find the speed in km/h,
multiply the speed in meters/round by 0.6. Inversely, to find the speed in
meters/round, divide the speed in km/h by 0.6.

<p>
<pre>
Standard speeds:

+-------------+----------------------+------------------------+---------+
|             |         Human        |      Other Species     | Fatigue |
|             |  km/hour    m/round  |                        | Rating  |
+-------------+----------------------+------------------------+---------+
| Base        |     3           5    | In species description |   (1)   |
| Walking     |     6          10    | 2*Base                 |   (1)   |
| Running     |    12          20    | 4*Base                 |   (3)   |
| Sprinting*  |    24          40    | 8*Base                 |   (7)   |
| Max**       |    36          60    | 12*Base                |  (10)   |
+-------------+----------------------+------------------------+---------+

</pre>

<p>
To decide which Base Speed is reasonable look at the speed ratings for humans:
<ul>
  <li> walking speed = Base Speed *2
  <li> running speed = Base Speed * 4
  <li> sprinting speed = Base Speed * 8
  <li> maximum speed = Base Speed * 12
</ul>
This means that a species with a Base Speed of 6 meters/round walking at a normal 
pace is as fast as a human who is jogging.
<p>
It is suggested that you specify the base, walking, running, sprinting and
maximum speeds in the species description, to simplify the life of game
masters and players. In  general, these speeds will be calculated from the
formulas above. If you want to use different formulas for your species, please
write them beside the calculated speeds. For example, the quantum leap monster
could have base speed of 30 meters/round with a walking speed of 90
meters/round (Base Speed * 3) and a maximum speed of 120 meters/round (Base
Speed * 4).

<a name="5">
<p>
<h3>5. Body Points</h3>
Each species will be rated with a constant BODY score of X.<br>
Add <em>(Body Points</em> - <em>Human Body Points)*10</em> to EP cost.
<p>

A good way to estimate the BODY of your new species is to set it in proportion
with its size relatively to humans. For example, if your species is twice as
tall as humans, its BODY should be twice as high. The human BODY is equal to
15 and the average human size is 1.8 meters.
<p>

<code>
Humanoid species BODY = (Species Height/Human Height) * Human BODY
</code>
<p>

However, if a species is more bulky than humans for its height, then its BODY
should be set higher. In the same manner, a very slim species should have a
lower BODY value than that calculated.
<p>

<em>Note: This may be subject to change.</em>

<p>
<h3>6. Natural Resistance</h3>

Natural Resistance (NR) represents the toughness of the species skin, tissues
and bones and their ability to withstand impact. It is the biological
equivalent of a suit of armor, which protects the character from cutting,
tearing and bludgeoning impacts.
<p>

A Natural Resistance of 0 corresponds to the resistance of the human skin,
tissues and bones. Smaller species will probably be more fragile, while bigger
ones will likely be more resistant. For humanoid species similar in
proportions to humans, it is recommended to set a Natural Resistance equal to
their Size Rating (SR) value (which can be found from the height of the species
in the Strength and Size Rating Table).
<p>

Note that Armor Resistance (the resistance of chain mail, ...) is the same
for every species, but that the resistance value used in combat is the sum
of the species Natural Resistance and the Armor Resistance.
<p>

<code>
Natural Resistance = Size Rating      (for humanoid species)
</code>

</a>

<a name="7">
<p>
<h3>7. Innate ISB, Gifts and Foibles</h3>
IMHO this is one of the main reasons why players want to have characters from
another race. Each specific species has something that makes it unique:
Gifts that help them to survive and foibles that are the burdens layed on the
shoulders of that race. This combination may make it interesting to play a
member of this species.

<p>
<b>ISB (= Innate Skill Bonus):</b><br>
An innate skill bonus is a bonus to a skill that all members of a species
possess. This bonus is applied when a character has learned this skill
and uses it. Generally, Innate Skill Bonuses apply only to physical skills.

<p>
The EP cost for ISB is calculated by:<br>
ISB Cost = ISB * (ISB+1) / 2 * Base EP Cost of Skill.

<p>
<code>
For example:<br>
Centaurs have an ISB +3 to running.<br>
The skill costs 3.<br>
This means the EP cost is: 3 * 4 / 2 * 3 = 18.
</code>

<p>
<b>Gifts:</b><br>
A gift is an advantage that is innate to all members of a species. It is normally
a physical advantage. The cost of the gifts are logically added to the EP cost.

<p>
<b>Foibles:</b><br>
These are physical or even psychological disadvantages that make it more difficult
to play the character. Their 'cost' will be substracted from the EP cost.
</a>

<a name="8">
<p>
<h3>8. Calculating EP cost</h3>
Now you have all the informations that you need to calculate the species' EP cost.
As I mentioned above you will have to pay the EP cost when you create a character
from a specific race.

The EP cost is calculated by applying the following modifiers:
<ol>
  <li> <b>Sum</b> all Talents modifiers. Add ten times this value to the 
          Species EP Cost (the result can be negative).
  <li> <b>Add</b> (Body Points - Human Body Points)*10
  <li> <b>Add</b> Natural Resistance * 10
  <li> <b>Add</b> all costs for ISB
  <li> <b>Add</b> all costs for gifts
  <li> <b>Substract</b> all costs for foibles  
</ol>
</a>

<a name="9">
<p>
<h3>9. Cultures</h3>
Now the statistic of the species are finished. These statistics should be the same
for all worlds in which this species will appear. The only difference between the
species on several worlds may be the cultures founded by them. Add the cultures
that will be the most likely formed by members of this species. You find culture
descriptions at the end of this book. They need only to be adapted to this race.
All the informations concerning cultures will be given in the next chapter.
<p>
</a>

<a name="10">
<p>
<h3>10. IMPACT done by a species weapons</h3>
Many humanoid species will use weapons that are scaled versions of human
weapons. For example, a pixie could wield a needle size sword and a giant
could use a club the size of a tree.
<p>
In order to maintain consistency across species, the IMPACT of such weapons
should be approximately equal to the sum of the IMPACT of the equivalent human
weapon and the species average Strength. The idea behind this scaling is that
a smaller and lighter weapon will do less damage than a larger one of similar
shape.
<p>

<code>
Species weapon IMPACT = Human weapon IMPACT + Species average STR
</code><p>

For example, the IMPACT of a pixie bastard sword would be equal to:
<p>
<pre>
Pixie bastard sword IMPACT = Human bastard sword IMPACT + Average Pixie STR
                           = 2d6 + 4                    - 20
                           = 2d6 - 16
</pre><p>
                           
(For those who find this value ridiculously small, pixies are 10 cm creatures
and their swords would do no more than a scratch to a human.)
