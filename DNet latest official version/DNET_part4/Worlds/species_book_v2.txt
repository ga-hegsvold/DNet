DragonNet Volume ??

Species
&
Cultures






The following book is the result of the continuous work of many role-players
from all over the world. We all came together to create a free role-playing
game called DragonNet (DNET). Free means: free to obtain and free for
distribution. It is our intended goal that no one should make more money out
of a game than it is worth. Many role-players are pupils or students. And this
is not a group of people with big money to spend for dozens of separate books
that contain all the rules needed for the game. The basic rules for DNET are
free to copy for everyone.

And:
We will surely not disallow designers to make adventures for DNET and sell
them. We will surely not disallow the use of the name DragonNet in the
Internet.

But all coordinated efforts need some kind of organization and rules. You will
find the copyright notice in the main rule book. But be sure that it's an
acceptable copyright.

I personally want to say that I am happy to be a member of the DragonNet
Development Team. The discussions in the project groups are very interesting.
And it is great to see how the Internet can be used for combined efforts of
people who likely will never personally meet.

1.0 Introduction
================

This book is a collection of species and culture descriptions. It is intended
to give game masters a variety of species for NPC's and monsters. The first
part contains the species template and a guide for GM's to create their own
species. In the second part you will find the culture template and a guide for
culture creation. The rest of the book contains species and culture
descriptions already defined by the dnworlds development team. The book is
easily expandable. You can insert self-defined species. The only thing you
have to do is to change and reprint the species lists.

Most of the species were created for the sample world Corellus. They are also
written down in the Corellus World Book. The descriptions in this book are
different from them. Here you will find generalized descriptions that contain
the same statistics as in the Corellus World Book but perhaps different (or
more) culture descriptions. The culture descriptions are the ones common to
that race. Or at least we thought that they are. ;-) When you compare the
Species & Cultures and the Corellus World Book then you can see the
differences. This may be a good guideline, if you like to adapt a race to your
own world.

The culture descriptions in the second part of the book are also generalized.
They show you how a specific culture may look like. They need only adaptations
to some species. For example: A civilized human culture looks different to a
civilized elven culture.


===================
2.0 Part 1: Species
===================

----------------------------
2.1 The species in DragonNet
----------------------------

This chapter contains: 

Species Template 
Guidelines for species creation 

Section 4.0 contains all the species contributed by the members of the
DragonNet Development Team. It is the author's intention to give you a
resource for PC's and monsters for your own game world. You can use them
directly out of the book or adapt them to your world.

When you adapt them:
The statistics of the species should be the same as in Species & Cultures. You
only have to choose which cultures have been formed by this species in your
world. The cultures used in the descriptions are the most likely ones that
will be formed by the species. But this book will only be a toolkit for you to
create your own species and cultures and bring life in your world.

When you rewrite one:
If you dislike a specific species description and rewrite it, change the
entries world and author to make it clear that it is a different description.
If you change the statistics of the species then choose a new name for it.
Since there will be (hopefully) several sites with resources for DNET it will
be confusing to have two or three different descriptions of one species. For
example: when you rewrite the dwarf using different statistics then you can
rename it to Big-Nose-Dwarf. ;-)

When you create a new species:
Look at the Guidelines for species creation. This should help you to make it,
if you are unexperienced. New species are always welcome in the dnworlds
development team. You can send your description to the dnworlds mailing list.
Here we will discuss it, give you feedback and add it to the Species &
Cultures book.

2.3 Guide to species creation
-----------------------------

Version 7.0
Author: Juergen Lechner
Last revision: Guillaume Fortin

You need to follow these steps to create a species:

  1. Deciding the general idea of the species
  2. Can a PC be from this species?
  3. Height, weight and lifespan
  4. Adjusting attributes / speed
  5. Body Points
  6. Natural Resistance
  7. Innate ISB, Gifts and Foibles
  8. Calculating EP cost
  9. Cultures
  10. IMPACT done by a species weapons

-------------------------------------------
1. Deciding the general idea of the species
-------------------------------------------

If you decide to create a new species then you normally have an idea of how
the species will look like and what are its special characteristics (i.e.
attributes, abilities, ...). If not, try to visualize a general picture of the
species and which role it will play in your world.

---------------------------------
2. Can a PC be from this species?
---------------------------------

If you want to create a new race for players then you need to calculate the EP
cost.This is the number of points that must be spent to choose this species as
a player character's race. Even if you create only a new monster then it will
be a good way to measure the strength of the species. Everything that gives
the new species some sort of power will raise the EP cost. And everything
disadvantageous to it will lower it. Balanced advantages and disadvantages
will keep the cost near 0.

------------------------------
3. Height, weight and lifespan
------------------------------

You then have to define the average

  -> height in m,
  -> weight in kg and
  -> lifespan in years. 

According to this you can also see which Size Rating the species has. This is
an additional value that will be used in combat. Humans have a size rating of
0.

- - - - - -
Size Rating
- - - - - -

You can determine the Size Rating (SR) of your species from the 
Strength and Size Rating Table given below. Find the average
height of your species in the Humanoid Height column and note the 
corresponding SR. Note that this SR is valid if your species has the same 
proportions as a human, i.e. if it has the same ratio as a human between 
height and width. If the species is larger for its height than a human, 
raise its SR value by 1. If it is slimmer, lower its SR by 1.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Strength and Size Rating Table
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The following table can be used to determine a number of factors relating 
to a creatures size and strength.

Size     Strength              Humanoid               LOAD   Humanoid

4. Adjusting attributes / speed
-------------------------------

The steps above will tell you in which way you may change the Talents of the
species. The average attributes of a human are all 0 and ranges normally from
-5 to +5. When you adjust a Talent, you decide how much it will differ from
the human standard. You do this by adding or subtracting a specific value.

For example:
The new species is taller and lighter than a human but more flexible
and agile. This could mean:
Talents modifiers: AGI +1, FIT -1, STR -1<br>

The resulting EP cost would be -10. This could offset the cost of another
advantage.

The Talents are:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               Physical
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  AGI    Agility             Body control; balance; rythm; flexibility
  BEA    Beauty              How nice you look
  DEX    Manual Dexterity    Hand-eye coordination; fine motricity of the 
                             arms and hands; sensivity to touch
  FIT    Fitness             Bodily health; resistance to hardship, injury 
                             or disease
  STR    Strength            Rating of Physical power for short and prolonged 
                             use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                Mental
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  AUR    Aura               Non-tangible complement to beauty; charisma
  INT    Intelligence       Memory; analytical and reasoning ability; 
                            speed of thought
  PER    Perception         Includes alertness and observational acuity
  PSY    Psyche             Creativity, Intuition, affinity to the natural 
                            and supernatural
  WIL    Willpower          Self discipline and mental fortitude 
                            (i.e. mental fitness)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a detailed description of the attributes please refer to the character
creation guide in the rules.

- - - - - -
Base Speed
- - - - - -

This is not an attribute but results directly from them. Decide which speed is
a logical result from its Talents and the species size. The base speed is
normally given in both meters/round and km/h. To find the speed in km/h,
multiply the speed in meters/round by 0.6. Inversely, to find the speed in
meters/round, divide the speed in km/h by 0.6.

Standard speeds:

+-------------+----------------------+------------------------+---------+
|             |         Human        |      Other Species     | Fatigue |
|             |  km/hour    m/round  |                        | Rating  |
+-------------+----------------------+------------------------+---------+
| Base        |     3           5    | In species description |   (1)   |
| Walking     |     6          10    | 2*Base                 |   (1)   |
| Running     |    12          20    | 4*Base                 |   (3)   |
| Sprinting*  |    24          40    | 8*Base                 |   (7)   |
| Max**       |    36          60    | 12*Base                |  (10)   |
+-------------+----------------------+------------------------+---------+

To decide which Base Speed is reasonable look at the speed ratings for humans:

  -> walking speed = Base Speed *2
  -> running speed = Base Speed * 4
  -> sprinting speed = Base Speed * 8
  -> maximum speed = Base Speed * 12

This means that a species with a Base Speed of 6 meters/round walking at a normal 
pace is as fast as a human who is jogging.

It is suggested that you specify the base, walking, running, sprinting and
maximum speeds in the species description, to simplify the life of game
masters and players. In  general, these speeds will be calculated from the
formulas above. If you want to use different formulas for your species, please
write them beside the calculated speeds. For example, the quantum leap monster
could have base speed of 30 meters/round with a walking speed of 90
meters/round (Base Speed * 3) and a maximum speed of 120 meters/round (Base
Speed * 4).

--------------
5. Body Points
--------------

Each species will be rated with a constant BODY score of X.
Add (Body Points - Human Body Points)*10 to EP cost.

A good way to estimate the BODY of your new species is to set it in proportion
with its size relatively to humans. For example, if your species is twice as
tall as humans, its BODY should be twice as high. The human BODY is equal to
15 and the average human size is 1.8 meters.

Humanoid species BODY = (Species Height/Human Height) * Human BODY

However, if a species is more bulky than humans for its height, then its BODY
should be set higher. In the same manner, a very slim species should have a
lower BODY value than that calculated.

Note: This may be subject to change.

---------------------
6. Natural Resistance
---------------------

Natural Resistance (NR) represents the toughness of the species skin, tissues
and bones and their ability to withstand impact. It is the biological
equivalent of a suit of armor, which protects the character from cutting,
tearing and bludgeoning impacts.

A Natural Resistance of 0 corresponds to the resistance of the human skin,
tissues and bones. Smaller species will probably be more fragile, while bigger
ones will likely be more resistant. For humanoid species similar in
proportions to humans, it is recommended to set a Natural Resistance equal to
their Size Rating (SR) value (which can be found from the height of the species
in the Strength and Size Rating Table).

Note that Armor Resistance (the resistance of chain mail, ...) is the same
for every species, but that the resistance value used in combat is the sum
of the species Natural Resistance and the Armor Resistance.

Natural Resistance = Size Rating      (for humanoid species)

--------------------------------
7. Innate ISB, Gifts and Foibles
--------------------------------

IMHO this is one of the main reasons why players want to have characters from
another race. Each specific species has something that makes it unique:
Gifts that help them to survive and foibles that are the burdens layed on the
shoulders of that race. This combination may make it interesting to play a
member of this species.

- - - - - - - - - - - - -
ISB (= Innate Skill Bonus)
- - - - - - - - - - - - -

An innate skill bonus is a bonus to a skill that all members of a species
possess. This bonus is applied when a character has learned this skill
and uses it. Generally, Innate Skill Bonuses apply only to physical skills.

The EP cost for ISB is calculated by:
ISB Cost = ISB * (ISB+1) / 2 * Base EP Cost of Skill.

For example:
Centaurs have an ISB +3 to running.
The skill costs 3.
This means the EP cost is: 3 * 4 / 2 * 3 = 18.

- - -
Gifts
- - -

A gift is an advantage that is innate to all members of a species. It is normally
a physical advantage. The cost of the gifts are logically added to the EP cost.

- - - -
Foibles
- - - -

These are physical or even psychological disadvantages that make it more difficult
to play the character. Their 'cost' will be substracted from the EP cost.

----------------------
8. Calculating EP cost
----------------------

Now you have all the informations that you need to calculate the species' EP cost.
As I mentioned above you will have to pay the EP cost when you create a character
from a specific race.

The EP cost is calculated by applying the following modifiers:

  1. Sum all Talents modifiers. Add ten times this value to the 
          Species EP Cost (the result can be negative).
  2. Add (Body Points - Human Body Points)*10
  3. Add Natural Resistance * 10
  4. Add all costs for ISB
  5. Add all costs for gifts
  6. Substract all costs for foibles  

-----------
9. Cultures
-----------

Now the statistic of the species are finished. These statistics should be the same
for all worlds in which this species will appear. The only difference between the
species on several worlds may be the cultures founded by them. Add the cultures
that will be the most likely formed by members of this species. You find culture
descriptions at the end of this book. They need only to be adapted to this race.
All the informations concerning cultures will be given in the next chapter.

------------------------------------
10. IMPACT done by a species weapons
------------------------------------

Many humanoid species will use weapons that are scaled versions of human
weapons. For example, a pixie could wield a needle size sword and a giant
could use a club the size of a tree.

In order to maintain consistency across species, the IMPACT of such weapons
should be approximately equal to the sum of the IMPACT of the equivalent human
weapon and the species average Strength. The idea behind this scaling is that
a smaller and lighter weapon will do less damage than a larger one of similar
shape.

Species weapon IMPACT = Human weapon IMPACT + Species average STR

For example, the IMPACT of a pixie bastard sword would be equal to:

Pixie bastard sword IMPACT = Human bastard sword IMPACT + Average Pixie STR
                           = 2d6 + 4                    - 20
                           = 2d6 - 16

(For those who find this value ridiculously small, pixies are 10 cm creatures
and their swords would do no more than a scratch to a human.)
