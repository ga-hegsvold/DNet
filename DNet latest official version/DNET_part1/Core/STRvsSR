Hi,

It seems that we have reached a point where we would all gain from sitting
around a table, trying to sort out why we should add STR and SR there and
there. Right now, we have different tables for SR and STR, and the link 
between these table is very small.

A while ago, Bob was saying that STR would generally be proportional to SR.
Right now, we have to tables which are almost unrelated. I will therefore
try to establish a relation between SR and STR, so that we can build more
coherent tables, and try to have the system working before we destroy it
(as Bob has already begun with his "simplified Impact").

Defining Size Rating
--------------------

The first thing we have to do is to define what means Size Rating. For example,
if an Ogre is twice as big as a human, does it mean he has twice the surface
or twice the volume? This will influence greatly the relation between SR and
STR, as we will see.

To ease the analysis below, I will consider only humanoid creatures, and will
approximate their shape as a rectangular box. (A human will therefore be
a box 2m high, 1m wide and 0.5m deep).

1. Size rating is proportional to VOLUME
   Human volume: 2m x 1m x 0.5m = 1 m^3
   Ogre volume = 2 m^3 = (SF x 2m) x (SF x 1m) x (SF x 0.5m) = SF^3 x 1 m^3
         -> SF^3 = 2 m^3 / 1 m^3 = 2
         -> SF = 1.26

   The ogre is 1.26 times taller, wider and deeper than a human.
   (SF is the scaling factor)
   
2. Size rating is proportional to SURFACE
   Human surface = 2 x (2m x 1m + 2m x 0.5m + 1m x 0.5m) = 7 m^2
   Ogre surface = 14 m^2 = SF^2 x 7 m^2
         -> SF^2 = 2
         -> SF = 1.41
  
   The ogre is 1.41 times taller, wider and deeper than a human.
   (SF is the scaling factor)

We should note that with the current Called Shot rules that are based on
SR, it makes more sense to have Size Rating proportional to surface.

Strength versus Size Rating
---------------------------

For this analysis, we will make the following assumptions:

1. Strength is proportional to the muscular mass.
2. The muscular mass is proportional to the body mass.
3. The body mass is proportional to the body volume.
4. From the above, strength is proportional to the body volume.

>From there, we can calculate the ration between Size and Strength for the
two possible cases of Size Rating (proportional to Surface or Volume).

1. With Size proportional to Volume.
   Both Size and Strength are proportional to the cube of the Scaling
   Factor (SF^3).
   Therefore: Strength/Size = 1
   and Size Rating and Strength Rating should use the same Table.

2. With Size proportional to Surface.
   Size is proportional to the square of the Scaling factor, while Strength is
   proportional to the cube of the Scaling factor.
   Strength/Size = SF^3 / SF^2 = SF

>From Ratios to Tables
---------------------

How do we get the Size Rating and avg STR Talent from the Strength and Size
Ratios? The best way is to establish a table with avg Str Talent and Size
Rating as a function of the scaling factor.

But before, we need formulas to go from Size and Strength (which are 
multipliers) to STR Ta and SR which are summed modifiers. A log operation is
required here.

If we say that everything is relative to humans, we have (for scaling factor
relative to Surface):

Size = SF^2
Strength = SF^3

Size Rating = log_N( Size ) = log_N( SF^2 ) = 2*log_N(SF)
avg STR Ta = log_N( Strength ) = log_N( SF^3 ) = 3*log_N(SF)

where log_N(X) is the logarithm of X is base N.

Note that these two equations define the relationship between SR and 
avg STR Ta. We can multiply both of these equations by the same constant,
since it won't change the ratio between SR and STR.

Sample table with N = 2.
------------------------

Size Rating = 2*log2(SF)
avg STR Ta = 3*log2(SF)

Scaling Factor     SR    STR
----------------------------
0.25               -4     -6
0.5                -2     -3
0.7                -1   -1.5
1                   0      0
2                   2      3
3                   3      5
4                   4      6

Remember that the scaling factor represents how much taller, wider, deeper a
creature is relatively to a human.

A quick word on Armor Resistance
--------------------------------

Someone noted that Armor Resistance should have the same thickness for all
species to have a reasonable weight for the species. With the reasonable
assumptions that avg STR is proportional to the Volume of the body and that
the Armor Surface is proportional to the surface of the body, we can see that
a bigger creature will be able to support a thicker armor, since its strength
grows faster than the surface of the armor.

All comments are welcome!
