SKILL DESCRIPTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTISTIC SKILLS

Acting
------


Disguise
--------
Confers the ability to alter one's general appearance in order to avoid
identification and deceive opponents. Encompasses alteration of height,
weight, posture and/or facial and body features. Often combined with the
acting skill.

Musical instrument
------------------
Confers proficiency in an instrument of choice.

Ventriloquism
-------------
Confers the seeming ability to project one's voice so that it appears to
emanate from inanimate objects, other people, or unusual locations. Good for
party tricks and for staring ale-house brawls.

ATHLETIC SKILLS

Acrobatics
----------
Confers the ability to swing from a chandelier, somersault through a stained
glass window, and land on one's horse, ready to make a getaway. Can be used
in combat to dodge or reduce the effects of a blow.

Climbing
--------
Lets a character scale vertical and near vertical surfaces such as smooth
walls and rough cliff-faces. Harder with slippery or featureless surfaces or
if burdened with accoutrements. Often combined with the falling and healing
skills :)

Contortion
----------
Enables the manipulation of one's body in order to move through small
openings, hide in absurdly small containers or edifices, and escape from
bonds.

Endurance
---------
Enables prolongation of application with regard to physically demanding
and/or mentally draining tasks. A swimmer nears exhaustion towards the end
of long swim; they apply their endurance skill, and if successful, can
continue swimming anew, as if refreshed for half as long again. Successive
uses of the skill increase task difficulty and reduce prolongation span.

Falling
-------
Enables the reduction of falling damage by such methods as slowing the rate
of descent by incidental surface contact, harm minimising impact postures,
and "dodging the spikes/aiming for the soft bits."

Juggling
--------
Confers an ability to manipulate balls and other objects primarily for
entertainment purposes. Subsumes minor sleight-of-hand techniques.

Jumping
-------
Confers a proficiency at spanning sudden drops such as those encountered
during rooftop chases or across mountain gorges, ready leaps onto elevated
stations such as tavern tables and desparation jumps out of first or second
story abodes.

Running
-------
Through a combination of running and power-walking, enables movement at
twice the normal rate for a fixed duration. A period of rest and
recuperation is required at the end of such exertion.

Swimming
--------
Confers the ability to float upon deep water and to traverse same in a
limited fashion. Heavy accoutrements, exhaustion, wounds, cold water, and
high waves make things harder.

Tightrope walking
-----------------
Enables safe transition along a strong rope strung between two points or any
similarly narrow and (generally) high-up path.

COMBAT SKILLS

Archery
-------
Pretty much covers all bows One arrow per round 

Articulated or Leveraged weapons
--------------------------------
Leveraged weapons (like a flail) are harder to use than a more straightforward 
weapon.  This covers all such weapons, one or two handed, with or without 
shield. Defensive actions are only for those with shield or against shorter
reach weapon.

Berserker-craz OR Battle Frenzy
-------------------------------
Basically all out attack.  Only way to defend is to stop attacking.  Once the 
AA style is started, must continue while opponent is fighting within reach.  
If there is no opponent fighting within reach, a successful WILL test allow 
free choice.  Fail will test requires continued fighting as Berserk-craz
chasing opponents if avail.  Any friend may become target if there is no 
opponent avail.

Bolas,whips
-----------
Self explanatory.

Close weapons
-------------
Knife, hand axe, cestus, baton, broken bottle 
One action per round attack or defend. 

Combat appraisal
----------------
Identify stuff like armour class, attack forms, special defences, 
susceptibilities.  How good is a fighter in the style used. Also is he tiring, 
injured, favoring a leg ...

Cross bow
---------
Rate of fire will be scored by weapon as will STR.  High STR crossbow weapons 
may only allow occasional fire 1/3 rounds to 1/10 rounds.  If there is a 1/1 
rate of fire, damage is minimal e.g. per dagger. 

Dodging
-------
Allows one to avoid taking damage from one successful hit. 

Evade Blows
-----------
Lets one defensively evade all blows but cannot attack this round or next.  
Evading is a big benny but leaves fighter out of position for attack.

Fencing
-------
Parry repost style fighting with light weight weapons -- edge or point 
attacks. This is not for unbalanced weapons like Axe or Mace.

Mounted
-------
Using weapons mounted is separate skill and of higher difficulty because of 
interaction with mount -- possible greater situational modifier if mount 
poorly or untrained for task. With highly trained mounts, mounts skill may 
reduce penalty.

Maneuvering in armour
---------------------
Some sort of skill to reflect the many hours of training required to become 
proficient in fighting in armour - deflecting/rolling with blows against your 
armour, adjusting to the change in your movement patterns, building up 
endurance, doing handstands in plate etc (just like medieaval knights 
practiced). {I don't know how this is used in game -- add skill to armour 
resistance up to doubling resistance (does this get a -5 if combined with an 
attack style?).  If used this way, is the hurdle too low?  Would this 
unbalance weapon armour balence?} If anything, this is not part of the basic 
game.  Unless there is an easy implementation of the skill.  

Multiple attack
---------------
The idea is to give up all actions in one round to have 1d6 actions (attacks) 
in the next round.   Not to clear what the test in the first round (TD 15) or 
how one defends against it happening.  Is an action (like defense) allowed in 
preparing round.  Are there target (all attacks against one target or attack 6 
separate individuals) or weapons restrictions (6 two handed flail attacks) or 
are the stat requirements (higher TR or AGL)?

Polearms
--------
Pole arms are commonly swung, having blade or pick.  They have a higher moment 
of inertia than twohanded weapons.  They also have some closer grip style that 
allows some parry action with the nether end ala quarter staff.  Most wielders 
of pole arms do not like to use that style, prefering to use weapon from 
second rank. If the weapon has spear point, it may also be used in thrusting 
style (see below).

Sapper/miner
------------
Knows how to build temp fortification and undermine temp or permanant 
fortifications.

Siege equipment
---------------
Knows how to assemble and aim siege equipment.

Single action
-------------
Only allows one attack or defence in a round; useful for mages and the like 
who do not have large need for combat skills. 

Strategy/Tactics
----------------
I don't see actually how to work these in.  Maybe characters (or their side) 
have lower TD or some such, open to ideas.

Thrown weapon
-------------
Throwing weapons (axe, knives, boomerang(?),darts, and even javelin and 
discus) designed for designed for throwing is it's own skill.  This can be 
performed as often as 1 per round if the weapons appropriately carried on the 
body (at girdle or similar -- not in pack).  When throwing into a melee 
situation, the rate should be slowed to 1/2 rounds or roll randomly for 
target. 

Thrusting weapons
-----------------
This to cover spears and such. This includes shield use for smaller shields. 
Includes one_attack_&_one_defend or two_attack actions or two FENDs per round. 
Thrusting weapon may be one handed with shield. Thrusting style does not use 
nether end for block, but forward shaft. Thrusting style also include FEND as 
an alternative to attack & defense.  Basically FEND keeps opponent with 
shorter weapon at a distance unable to attack.  Opponent who loses against 
FEND either can not attack or b) takes automatic hit at full damage (maximum 
for thrusting weapon and STR bonus).  Optional precision bonus applies to the 
success of the FEND.  User may choose two FEND actions in leu of the normal 
one_attack_&_one_defend action in a round.   

Weapon/shield
-------------
Covers basic one-handed smashing (club, mace, axe, pick) and cutting 
(scimitar), and thrusting weapons (estoc*).  Also covered is one hand use of 
'hand and half' weapons and targe/two hand use of these same. Includes 
one_attack_&_one_defend or two_defend actions per round.
> * pointy-sword aimed at the joins in armour 

Additional attack
-----------------
Allows _an_ additional action with a defined weapon style at this skill level 
(or at weapon style skill level if lower).  There are no penalties to this 
attack or the regular attack as there are normally for combined actions. 
Additionally minimum multiple attack STR rating must be meet for the weapon. 
This is higher than min STR just to use the weapon in the style. STR damage 
bonuses do not apply to either regular or additional attack. Special form of 
this "Additional Shield" allows multiple shield defence up to limits of shield 
size.

Unarmed
-------
Fisticuffs, wrestling, ...

Exotic unarmed
--------------
Savate, Karate, Judo, etc.  Rules for those undecided.

Flowing water, Marching tower, Swaying tree
--------------------------------------------
I will eventually give you description for these.  They are weapon techniques 
that feature passing thorugh lines,  Heavy damage to continuous advance, or 
repost to any parried attack (but no initiated attack).  Other special attack 
forms(?? --  Must no basic weapon style, then form can be added)
