So that I Guillaume and I come together completely I've decided to add a few
of my modifications to his SIMPLE system. (We basically were proposing the
same thing, I had just added a few extra complexities that others quickly
pointed out were unnecessary)  -Bob

==============================================
1) Definition of how Attributes affect skills:
==============================================

Attributes influence skills in two ways:

1) Natural Ability gives you a basic skill level for the easier skills.

2) It is easier for a person with more Natural Ability to learn a skill
   than it is for an average person. In the same manner, an average person
   can learn a skill more easily than a below average one.


=============================
2) Definition of Skill Level:
=============================

Skill level is composed of two parts:

1) Basic Skill Level   (BSL) (determined by Natural Ability)
2) Learned Skill Level (LSL) (determined by experience with the skill)

The combination is referred to as Skill Level (SL) and is calculated with the
formula:
  
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  | Skill level = Basic skill level + Learned skill level |
  |          SL = BSL + LSL                               |
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  

=====================================
3) Skill Acquisition and Advancement:
=====================================

Basic skill levels simply are the skill levels for which the learning cost is 
negative or 0, as shown below.

The added cost in advancement points to go from one skill level to the next is:

   ------------------------------------------------------------
   | AP cost = Skill Level * Acq./Adv. Cost - Natural Ability |
   |      AP = SL * AC - NA                                   |
   ------------------------------------------------------------

where:

-> Skill level is the level of the skill to be reached

-> Acq./Adv. Cost is as follows:

  ---------------------------
  Acq./Adv.       | Acq./Adv.
  Difficulty (AD) |   Cost
  ---------------------------
  Trivial   (T)   |    10
  Easy      (E)   |    20
  Average   (A)   |    30
  Difficult (D)   |    40
  Extreme   (X)   |    50

-> NA = AV*AV/10     (AV = 1 -> NA = 1; AV = 20 -> NA = 40)

Example
-------

I have an Agility of 12 (NA = 14) and I want to learn to use the short bow 
(average AD). To reach skill level 1, I must pay:

  AP cost = 1 * 30 - 14 = 16
  
If I want to improve again, I must pay an additional:


  AP cost = 2 * 30 - 14 = 46

  
After this new training, I have a skill level of 2 with the short bow.

Interpretation of the formula
-----------------------------

a) Average humans (AV = 10) have a Basic Skill Level(BSL) of 1 in all Trivial 
   skills before any training (that's why those skills are trivial).

b) Below average humans require some 'training' to acquire skill level 1 in
   Trivial skills.

c) Above average persons can have Basic Skill Levels in Trivial, Easy and 
   Average skills, before any training. At the extreme of the human scale 
   (AV = 20), one has:

   level 4 in Trivial skills: level 1 -> Skill cost = 10 - 40 = -30
			      level 2 -> Skill cost = 2*10 - 40 = -20

			      level 3 -> Skill cost = 3*10 - 40 = -10
			      level 4 -> Skill cost = 4*10 - 40 = 0
			      Higher levels have a positive cost 
			      (i.e. are not free)

   level 2 in Easy skills: level 1 -> Skill cost = 20 - 40 = -20
			   level 2 -> Skill cost = 2*20 - 40 = 0
			   Higher levels have a positive cost 

			   (i.e. are not free)
   
   level 1 in Average skills: level 1 -> Skill cost = 30 - 40 = -10


=================================================
4) Effect on Skill Level due to attribute change:
=================================================

If an attribute of a character's is modified after the character's creation, 
the levels of the skills related to that attribute will also change. As it has
been said, a skill level is composed of two parts:

1) Basic Skill Level   (BSL) (determined by Natural Ability)
2) Learned Skill Level (LSL) (determined by experience with the skill)

When the value of one of his attributes is changed, the character does not 
gain or lose any knowledge (unless there is a massive brain damage, which
calls for GM ruling). However, the change in attribute increases or decreases
his basic skill level. Therefore, the skill level should be modified in the
following way:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Skill level = Previous Skill Level + (New NA - Prev. NA)/(Acq./Adv. cost) |
  |          SL = Previous SL + (New NA - Previous NA) / AC                   |
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if an attribute changes from 20 (NA = 40) to 10 (NA = 10), all 
trivial skills related to this attribute will suffer a change of -3 skill 
levels:

  Variation in skill levels = (New NA - Previous NA) / AC
			    = (10 - 40) / 10 = -3


** Mathematical justification **

One can prove easily that the Basic Skill Level for any skill is given by:

   BSL = NA / AC
   
Therefore, the change in the Basic Skill Level with a change in NA is as 
follows:

  New BSL - Previous BSL = (New NA/AC) - (Previous NA/AC) 
			 = (New NA - Previous NA) / AC

  
=============================
5) Maximum Skill Level (MSL):
=============================

MSL is considered the maximum skill level that can be obtained with an AV=10.
MSL is modified (decreased for AV<10, increased for AV>10) by using the formula:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  | MSL = for AV <= 10: NA/10 * MSL      (rounded up to avoid 0s)      |
  |       for AV >  10: MSL*NA/100 + MSL (rounded up to be consistent) |
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples: Chess, Difficult, MSL 15
	  Joe Smart (INT 20) acquires chess. His MSL is increased to:
	     MSL*NA/100 + MSL = 15*40/100 + 15 = 600/100 + 15 = 21
	  Dumbo  (INT 3) acquires chess. His MSL is decreased to:
	     NA/10 * MSL = 1/10 * 15 = 1.5 = 2

	  Fire-building, Easy, MSL 4
	  Nim Bulfingers (ManDEX 18) acquires fire-building. His MSL becomes:
	     MSL*NA/100 + MSL = 4*32/100 + 4 = 128/100 + 4 = 5.28 = 6
	  Mr. Thumbs (ManDEX 5) has a MSL of:
	     NA/10 * 4 = 3/10 * 4 = 1.2 = 2

Whether AC should also be part of the calculation of MSL is left for debate...


===========================
6) Unskilled Modifier (UM):
===========================

Every skill would list an Unskilled Modifier (UM) in its definition.

Unskilled Modifier is a number that is added to the base difficulty when
attempting to use a skill that one is not skilled in. The modifier could
be adjusted at times when a player chooses to attempt something unskilled
that is related to a skill he IS proficient with.

Formula for determining minimum UM is in progress...

====================
7) Skill Resolution:
====================

To successfully use a skill, the following relation must be true 
(Die roll = 1d100):

  -------------------------------------------------
  | Die roll + Skill level * 5 >= Task difficulty |
  -------------------------------------------------

With Die roll = 1d20 or 2d10, we have the equivalent:

  ---------------------------------------------
  | Die roll + Skill level >= Task difficulty |
  ---------------------------------------------


===========================
8) Unskilled (Level 0) use:
===========================

Attempts to perform a task that is skill related when one is unskilled are
successfull if the following relation is true (die roll = 1d100):


  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Die roll + (NA - 10 ) >= Task difficulty + 2 levels of difficulty |
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

                            OR (alternative)

  ---------------------------------------------------------

  | Die roll + NA >= Task difficulty + Unskilled Modifier |
  ---------------------------------------------------------


====================
9) Attribute Checks:
====================

To succeed in a task that is not skill related (ex: bending bars), the
following relation must be true (die roll = 1d100):

  -------------------------------------------
  | Die roll + (NA - 10) >= Task difficulty |
  -------------------------------------------
Where the task difficulty is defined for an average human (AV = 10).
This automatically implies the use of NA - 10, which is 0 for an AV of 10,
giving no bonus or penalties to average persons (they are the reference)...

                   OR

  -----------------------------------------
  | Die roll + NA >= Task difficulty + 10 |
  -----------------------------------------
Which is consistent with the Unskilled Modifier approach.


For rolls on 1d20 or 2d10, the relation becomes:

  -------------------------------------------
  | Die roll + (NA/5 - 2) > Task difficulty |
  -------------------------------------------

                     OR

  -------------------------------------------
  | Die roll + (NA/5) > Task difficulty + 2 |
  -------------------------------------------

Note: this system would work better with 2d10, as a person with an AV of 2
      (NA = 0) would only get a penalty of 10% when attempting a task with
      a linear system... With 2d10, the effect of the -2 penalty is more
      pronounced... Moreover, the -2 penalty is a much greater hindrance for
      task with a high difficulty than for those with a low one, which is
      logical as a low attribute should not make it impossible to perform
      trivial tasks, while making it much harder to perform difficult ones.
