Movement
--------

The movement rules detailed below attempt to cover in a sensible manner most
game situations where movement plays a critical part . However, they might be
cumbersome in situations where movement is not critical and the game master is
free to use them when and as he wishes. It is only suggested that he employs
the standard movement speeds (base, walking, running, sprinting and maximum).

Movement speeds
---------------

Movement speeds are divided in 5 broad categories: base, walking, running and 
sprinting and maximum. 

The base movement speed is the reference from which the three others are
calculated. The speed of a character in a melee combat situation is also equal
to the base speed (see "6.6.1 Movement in Combat").

The walking speed is equal to a good but sustainable walking pace, the running
speed is a moderate jogging and the sprinting speed is a hurried run. For
comparison purposes, olympic marathoneers runners move at a pace between
running and sprinting (~19 km/h) and the maximum movement rate listed is that
of the olympic sprinters (100 meters in 10 seconds).

In order to simplify the rules, it is considered that all members of a species
can sustain the speeds given in the table below, for a short period of time
(until their first movement check).

+-------------+----------------------+------------------------+
|             |         Human        |  Other species         |

+-------------+----------------------+------------------------+
*: 100 meters in 15 secs
**: 100 meters in 10 secs

Movement checks
---------------

A character must do periodic movement checks to see if he can continue to
move at a given speed despite the accumulated fatigue. The checks are
done using:

2d10* + Training + Talent >= 5 + Fatigue

Before making each movement check, the player must increase the character's
fatigue by one plus its encumbrance penalty. The check is made after fatigue
has been increased. The Talent that is used in the check depends on the speed
at which the character goes: FIT for speeds below Sprinting and STR for speeds
above that. The character's training in "Endurance" or "Sprinting" is also
added to the roll (see below).

If the character's roll added to his Talent and Training is greater than his
accumulated Fatigue plus 5, then the character can continue running at the
same speed. If not, then the character must slow down by its base speed (a
human running at 12 km/h would slow down by 3 km/h and would thus end up at 9
km/h). A character can accelerate at any time, as long as he has been
successful in his last movement check.

Note that Fatigue is necessary for the movement system, even if it is not used
in other parts of the system. Using Fatigue with the movement mechanics gives
pretty realistic results.

While the base TD is 5 up to the sprinting speed, the frequency of the checks
changes with the movement rate. For example, a character needs to check only
once per hour when walking but must make a check every minute when sprinting.
The faster the character goes, the faster he gets fatigued.

                   1 round                    11*Base or more       (10)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, the frequency of the checks double each time the movement rate
increases by the base speed.

A character can always start to walk, run or sprint without a check, as long 
as he doesn't try to go over the standard sprinting speed (this case is treated 
below) or does not suffer from heavy fatigue. If the game master judges that
a character is to tired to move, then he can force the player to make a
movement check before starting to move (no fatigue is added to the Fatigue
heap before making this check). If the check passes, then the character
moves normally. If the check fails, then the game master can either impose
a maximum speed for the character or require that the character rests before
starting to move. In the later case, the character can attempt to move as
soon as he his Fatigue heap has been reduced by one point or more.

Example:
A human runner wants to finish a marathon in about 2 hour and 10 minutes. To 
cover the 42 km in about 130 minutes, he thus needs to go at about 19 km/h,
which is approximately equal to 6 times the base speed of 3 km/h. He will
thus have to make a movement check every 4 minutes. (Note: running a marathon
in 2h10min is a world class performance)

Our marathon runner has an Endurance skill of 30 (Training = 25, FIT = +5).
After 4 minutes of running, his Fatigue heap is increased by one and he has to 
make a first movement check:

2d10* + Endurance >= 5 + Fatigue
2d10* + 30        >= 5 + 1

It is quite obvious that he has virtually no chance of failing this check.
In fact, he is almost certain of being successful in the first 25 checks
(unless he rolls a fumble). This well trained runner can thus run at 
19 km/h for 100 minutes (25 checks * 4 minutes/check) without any major 
problem. It only starts getting difficult for him in the last 30 minutes,
when he has to give his last energies to maintain the same rythm.

If a similar situation occurs in a game, it is strongly suggested that the 
game master does not require the players to roll for checks that are always
successful unless the character fumbles. The players should thus start to
roll only when the task difficulty is higher than their skill. For our marathon
runner, this means that he needs to roll only the last seven check. The first
of these check is:

2d10* + 30 >= 5 + 26

while the seventh is:

2d10* + 30 >= 5 + 32

If he makes these seven movement checks successfully, he will have completed
the marathon in 2h10min!

Moving faster than the standard sprinting speed
-----------------------------------------------

The sprinting speed given in the movement rates table is the speed that all
members of a species can sustain for a short period of time (1 minute). If
a characters wants to go faster than the standard sprinting speed, he faces
a greater difficulty than just having to make more frequent checks. For each
increment of speed equal to the base speed, 5 is added to the task difficulty.
Thus, to run 100 meters in 10 seconds, a character would need to go at 
60 meters/round, which means an increase of 20 of the task difficulty. In 
addition, the character needs to make a movement check every round.

The check that a human needs to make to run 100 meters in 10 seconds is:

2d10* + Talent + Training >= 25 + Fatigue

When a character wants to move at a speed greater than the standard sprinting
speed, he also needs to make an initial movement check. No fatigue is added
to the Fatigue heap before making this check (Fatigue is always added at the
end of the movement period). 

If a character tries to move faster than the sprinting speed but fails his
check, the maximum speed that he can reach is obtained by substracting Fatigue
from his total roll and comparing the result with the Movement TD in the table
below. The maximum speed that he can reach corresponds to the maximum movement
TD that is smaller or equal to his adjusted roll. For example, if a sprinter
rolls a total 16 on his movement check and has a Fatigue of 3, then his
adjusted roll is 13 and he can reach a maximum speed of 9 times the base
speed.

The maximum speed that a character can reach is equal to 12 times the base 
speed. For a human, this speed is equal to 60 meters/round, which is equivalent
to running 100 meters in 10 seconds, a feat that only olympic athletes can
achieve. Of course, the game master is free to remove this limitation on
maximum speed.

----------------------------------
Speed                  Movement TD
----------------------------------
Sprinting or below               5
9*Base                          10
10*Base                         15
11*Base                         20
Maximum                         25
----------------------------------

Example:
An olympic athlete with Sprinting skill of 25 (Training = 20, STR = +5)
is on the starting line for the 100 meters race. As he is fully rested, his 
Fatigue is initially equal to 0. Upon hearing the gun, he jumps from the 
starting blocks. An initial movement check is made:

2d10* + Sprinting Skill >= Movement Task Difficulty + Fatigue
2d10* + 25              >= 5 + 20                   + 0
8     + 25              >= 25
33                      >  25           -> success

This initial movement check is successful and the character is thus moving
at 60 meters per round. However, since his speed his equal to 12 times the
base rate, he must make a check every round. He will thus have to make another
check after one round (6 seconds) of running. His Fatigue heap is increased
by one due to the first round of sprinting and his second movement check
is:

2d10* + Sprinting Skill >= Movement Task Difficulty + Fatigue
2d10* + 25              >= 5 + 20                   + 1
13    + 25              >= 26
38                      >  26           -> success

This second check is also successful and the sprinter makes it to the finish
line in 10 seconds!

Movement skills
---------------

For movement below sprinting speed, players should use the "Endurance"
skill in the movement check, or Fitness if their character does not
possess the Endurance skill. For movement at or above sprinting speed,
players should use the "Sprinting" skill or the Strength talent of their
character.

If a character does not have a Training in either Running or Sprinting, he
does not face an Untrained penalty (UP=0). These skills are considered to
be common enough that everyone has a basic training in them.

Moving among obstacles
----------------------

The standard movement rules work well when the character's movement is not
hindered. However, in many situations, the character will have to run in less
than ideal conditions and will have to exercise his agility more and more as
he tries to reach greater speeds.

When a character tries to move quickly among obstacles, the game master can 
require that he makes an agility check:

2d10* + AGI >= Task Difficulty + Fatigue

The Task Difficulty is calculated by adding the Terrain TD modifier to the 
Speed TD calculated from the movement speed.

Task Difficulty = Speed TD + Terrain TD modifier

For example, Sprinting on fresh snow has a TD of:

TD = 16 - 5 = 11

Thus, if a character with AGI = 1 wants to sprint on fresh snow, the game
master can ask him to make the following check:

2d10* + 1 >= 11 + Fatigue

While it is nice to know if a character can move at a given speed on a given
type of terrain, this is generally not useful during a game. What most players
want to know is how fast their character manages to go on a given terrain.
This can be easily found by rolling 2d10*, adding AGI, substracting from it
the Terrain TD modifier and the character's Fatigue, and comparing the result
to the Speed TD. The greatest Speed TD that is lower than or equal to the
total roll gives the speed that the character manages to reach. The two
examples below apply this technique.

Even if he is making agility checks for movement, the character still needs to
make movement checks and increase his Fatigue heap periodically. These checks
are based on the fastest speed that the character has reached while moving.
For example, if a character running through a forest has reached the sprinting
speed, then he will need to increase his Fatigue heap and make a movement 
check vs STR after one minute.

The game master is free to require agility checks for movement whenever he
deems appropriate. In general, it is better to use these checks only when
there is a chase or a similar situation. For long distance movement over rough
terrain or other non-critical situations, it is suggested that the game master
simply adjust the normal movement speed of the character. He might decree for
examples that the characters only cover 4 km/h when walking in a forest
instead of the normal 6 km/h.

*No check necessary in most situations.

Example:
As Ronan comes back to his camp in the woods, he sees that someone is
rummaging in his pack. When the intruder sees Ronan, he starts sprinting
through the woods and Ronan goes after him. Since they are moving in a forest
(Terrain TD mod = 0), the two runners will need a lot of Agility to go fast.
The game master decides to require an agility check from them every round,
even if their Fatigue will only be increased every minute (since they are
moving at Sprinting speed). Ronan has an AGI of 2 and an initial fatigue of 4
(he is coming back from hunting); the person he surprised has an AGI of 3, but
a Fatigue of 8, due to a prolonged lack of food. The 'thief' has an head start
of 20 meters over Ronan.

To determine their speed, both runner need to roll:
2d10* + AGI - Terrain TD modifier - Fatigue 

First round: Ronan's roll: 6 + 2 - 0 - 4 = 4     -> Walking = 10m/round
             Thief's roll: 5 + 3 - 0 - 8 = 0     -> Base    =  5m/round
             During the first round, Ronan has covered 5 meters more than
             the 'thief' he is pursuing. They are now separated by only
             15 meters.

Second round: Ronan's roll: 15 + 2 - 0 - 4 = 13  -> 6*Base  = 30m/round
              Thief's roll: 11 + 3 - 0 - 8 =  6  -> 3*Base  = 15m/round
              Ronan catches the 'thief', who does not engage a fight.
              They will have a long discussion on what he was doing there...
              
Example:
While walking in a busy marketplace (Terrain TD mod = -5), Neila feels a hand
grabbing her pouch. She turns to see that a man is fleeing with a 5 meters
headstart on her. Neila has an AGI of 2 is not fatigued. The thief is no more
fatigued and has an AGI of 1.

To determine their speed, both runner need to roll:
2d10* + AGI - Terrain TD modifier - Fatigue 

First round: On the first round, the thief tries to throw a cask full of 
             apples in Neila's way as he passes by it. This additional
             actions will give him a penalty of 5 on both actions (running
             and overturning the cask).
             Neila's roll: 9 + 2 - (-5) - 0 = 16      -> Sprinting = 40m/round
             Thief's roll: 15 + 1 - (-5) - 0 - 5 = 16 -> Sprinting = 40m/round
               Overturning the cask: 2d10* + STR - 5 >= 15
                                     27    +  0  - 5 = 22  -> success
                                     
Second round: Neila is still following 5 meters behind the thief, but she now
              has to avoid a cask of apples that is falling in her way. This
              will give her a penalty of 5 on her movement roll (such 
              penalties should be made up on the fly by the game master)
              Neila's roll: 15 + 2 - (-5) - 0 - 5 = 17 -> Sprinting = 40m/round
              Thief's roll: 13 + 1 - (-5) - 0 = 19     -> 9*Base    = 45m/round
                To run faster than the sprinting speed, the thief needs to
                make a Movement check: 2d10* + STR >= Movement TD
                                       2d10* + 0   >= 10
                                       4 + 0 = 4
                The check is failed and the thief continues to sprint at 
                40 m/round.
              
Third round: Neila is still following 5 meters behind the thief, who engages 
             in a network of small streets (Terrain TD mod = -10). Since the 
             thief knows those streets well, he will have a bonus of 3 on his 
             movement roll.
             Neila's roll: 13 + 2 - (-10) - 0 = 25     -> Maximum = 60m/round
               Moving faster than the sprinting speed:
                   2d10* + STR >= 25
                   9     + 3   = 12   
                   -> Failed, will be moving at 9*Base (45 m/round)
             Thief's roll: 11 + 1 - (-10) - 0 + 3 = 24 -> Maximum = 60m/round
                Moving faster than the sprinting speed:
                   2d10* + STR >= 25
                   9     + 0   = 9   
                   -> Failed, will be moving at the sprinting speed (40 m/round)
             Neila catches up with the thief, who takes out a long dagger. The
             rest of the encounter will be carried out with the combat rules.
             
Encumbrance
-----------

The load that each character can carry without ill effects varies with his
Strength and is given in the Strength Table. When a character is loaded with
more weight than his Strength allows, his Fatigue rises faster than if he
was normally loaded.

The additional Fatigue that a character suffers when he is heavily loaded
is equal to the Encumbrance penalty, which is calculated from the LOAD and
LOAD STEP values of the Strength Table. When the carried weight is lower
than or equal to the character's allowed LOAD, then the Encumbrance Penalty
is equal to O. When the weight carried is greater than this LOAD, the 
Encumbrance Penalty is increased by one for every of weight equal to LOAD
STEP (or fraction of LOAD STEP).

Encumbrance Penalty = (Weight-LOAD) / LOAD STEP        (round up)

For example, a character with STR = 2 can normally carry 35 kg and has a LOAD
STEP of 3.5 kg. If the character chooses to carry 40 kg, i.e. he carries 5 kg
more than allowed, he faces an Encumbrance Penalty of 2.

Encumbrance Penalty = (40 kg - 35 kg) / 3.5 kg
                    = 5 kg / 3.5 kg
                    = 1.43            
                    = 2 (rounded up)

Each time this character will increase his Fatigue heap, he will increase it
by 3 (1 plus the Encumbrance Penalty). See the Fatigue rules for more details.

The encumbrance system only takes into account the mass of items, not their
bulkiness. As always, a gamemaster may state that the character suffers an
additional penalty on his skill checks because he is loaded with large
items. For example, a game master has the right to impose a penalty
of 10 on all skill checks to a character who is carrying a canoe, even if
the character has the strength to do it. This is left to each game master, as 
we feel that such situations are not very common and that threating them 
here would just add unnecessary complexity to the rules.

OPTIONAL: The game master can decide that the Encumbrance Penalty is also
applied on some or all skills checks in addition to contributing to Fatigue;
he can also decide that Encumbrance only affects skill checks if the Fatigue
system is not used. When the Encumbrance Penalty is applied on a skill check,
the task difficulty is increased by the value of the Encumbrance Penalty. For
example, if the character from the example above wants to jump over a 1.5
meters fence while carrying 40 kg, the game master can decide to apply the
Encumbrance Penalty on the skill check:

2d10* + Jumping Skill >= Task Difficulty + Fatigue + Encumbrance Penalty

Fatigue (OPTIONAL)
-------

Efforts
-------

Each time a character performs an action, he accumulates Fatigue, be it mental
or physical. This accumulated Fatigue makes it harder for him to perform
subsequent actions. At some point, he is too fatigued to do anything correctly
and has to rest. (For simplicity, both mental and physical fatigue are
encompassed by the Fatigue heap).

Some skills will tire your character faster than others. For example, reading
is less draining that moving 10 kg rocks to build a wall. Thus, the person
moving rocks will get tired much faster than the person reading.

To take this into account, each character has a Fatigue heap, which is
initially at 0 when he is fully rested and which increases as the character
performs various activities. The more exacting these activities are, the
faster the Fatigue heap increases.

Taking a second look at our above example, we could qualify reading as a light
effort, while moving rocks would be a moderate exercise. The character moving
rocks would thus have to increase is Fatigue every 15 minutes, while the one
reading would only increase it every hour.

The Fatigue heap is always increased by 1 plus the Encumbrance Penalty (see
section "X.1 Encumbrance"*) each time it is augmented, no matter which
activity is performed. The frequency at which the Fatigue heap is increased
depends on the effort required by the skill or activity. In the case of
skills, one or more Fatigue Ratings will be associated with various uses of
the skill, which makes it easy to find the Fatigue increment frequency. For
movement, this frequency depends on the movement speed and the appropriate
rules can be found in "X.3 Movement". As usual, the game master can always
change the frequency at which Fatigue is increased.

While many skills will have one or Fatigue ratings associated with them, the
game master will often have to come up with Fatigue ratings for task. In that
case, we recommend that the game master describes the effort required in words
and then associates this effort with the appropriate frequency for increasing
Fatigue. For example, a task that requires a moderate-heavy effort would
require to increase the Fatigue heap every 4 minutes.

Note: the Fatigue system is optional for most skill checks but is recommended
for the magic and movement systems. In the magic system, Fatigue limits the
number of spells that can be cast, while in the movement system it limits the
distance that can be covered. If you do not use Fatigue for magic or movement,
you will end up with an insanely heroic setting (where characters can sprint
for 100 km or cast 100 spells in a row...).

Recuperation
------------

A resting character recovers one Fatigue point every 15 minutes. A sleeping
character recovers one Fatigue point every 8 minutes (or two every 15
minutes). Samples activities that can be considered as resting are: talking,
eating, sitting, meditating, ... Of course, the character must not perform
another activity at the same time.
