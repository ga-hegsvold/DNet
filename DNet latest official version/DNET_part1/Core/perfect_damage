IMO, the basic formula for BODY would be more like BODY = SR ...
You will see what I mean below when I explain my (new) views on Weapon Damage.

As I have stated many times before, we must keep Size Rating separate from STR.
A species with a low SR might have a high STR.

As I have explained, Armor resistance should be modified by the average species
STR. (i.e. stronger species can wear thicker armors)

On the other hand, Weapon damage should be modified by SR, since how tall you
are generally determines the size of the weapons you can wield.

With the new body system, the best adjustments to Weapon Impact (WI) and Armor
Resistance (AR) are (IMNSHO):

Other Species AR = Human AR + Other Species average STR
Other Species WI = Human WI + Other Species SR

If we combine this system with Body = SR (for species with the same body 
density, thougher species will have higher Body than SR), we get a system in
which two opponent of the same race, armored similarly and with the same 
weapon type will kill each other in the same time!

As we can see in the damage equation, SR and STR disappear for opponents of 
the same species (with BODY = SR):

DAMAGE = Weapon Impact + STR - (Body + AR)
       = Human Weapon Impact + SR + STR - (SR + Human AR + STR)
       = Human Weapon Impact - Human AR

If we set Body = CONSTANT + SR (so that characters don't die to fast), the
equation still holds:

DAMAGE = Human WI - (Human AR - CONSTANT)

What do you think? I can't see a flaw! Je ne me tiens plus de joie!
