No you did not.

Yes, if size mult is 16 (that's 4 times the height of a human!!), then the
strength mult is 4^3 = 64 times stronger than a human... However, I don't
think that log2 is appropriate.

I have been playing with 1.2 as the log base and it gives much better STR Ta.
Of course, it does not solve the problem of SR.

What I did was similar to this (when I came up with log 1.2). I decided that
+5 STR Ta would be 2.5 times stronger than +0 STR Ta. This gave me the
log 1.2. The problem is that +5 STR Ta is also associated with a +3 SR. So
long for the human SR of 0... (+3 makes a big difference in our targeting
equation).

The only solution is to fudge the Strength equation. We will have to say that
STR is no more proportional to volume, but to a higher exponent of the scaling
factor.

For example, we could have:

Strength = SF^4
(with SR = SF^2)

This would give:

avg STR Ta = logN(SF^3)
            = 4 * logN(SF)

we can cheat even more and have: avg STR Ta = 5 * logN(SF)

With (avg STR Ta = 4*logN(SF)), where N = 1.2, we get:

 SF     SR     STR
------------------
0.1    -25     -50
0.2    -18     -35
0.3    -13     -26
0.4    -10     -20
0.5     -8     -15
0.6     -6     -11
0.7     -4      -8
0.8     -2      -5
0.9     -1      -2
1.0      0       0
1.2     +2      +4
1.5     +4      +9
2.0     +8     +15
3.0    +12     +24
4.0    +15     +30
5.0    +17     +35
10.0   +25     +50
20.0   +33     +66
100.0  +51    +101

While we are at it we can also fudge by using two different log scales:

log 1.5 for SR and log 1.2 for STR could give nice results...

avg STR Ta = 3*log1.2(SF)
SR = 2*log1.5(SF)

Note that this is equivalent to fudging the exponents:

avg STR Ta / SR = 3/2 * (log1.5(SF)/log1.5(1.2))/log1.5(SF)
                = 3/2 * (1/0.45) = 3.33

which is equivalent to: Strength = SF^6.66
                        Size = SF^2

A quick table with fudged log scales:

SF    SR    STR
---------------
0.1  -11    -38
0.5   -3    -11
0.7   -2     -6
1.0    0      0
1.5   +2     +7
2.0   +3    +11
3.0   +5    +18
5.0   +8    +26
10.0 +11    +38

And then we face the problem that pixies are not strong enough to hurt a 
human... What do we do... Fudge again... We could have a different formula
for STR Ta for creatures that below human size than for creatures that are
over human size...

You get the picture...

After all this analysis, we have two choices. Either we go the realistic way
and only have "giants", or we go the heroic way and have whatever we want, 
even if we have to throw realism overboard... If only there were really 
pixies and giants... We would only have to measure their strengths...

All I ask is that we try to use scalable formulas for IMPACT! This will be
the most important point for GMs who wish to have pixies campaigns. Most won't
really care if a HUMAN is not as terrible for a pixie as a GIANT is for a
human... (But they will certainly like the fact that combat between pixies
work as expected...)
