Hi,

While washing the dishes (TD = 20, based on Willpower), I considered the issue
of combining efforts to accomplish a task and I think that I found a simple
and relatively elegant solution.

If two person with different Talents (Ta1 and Ta2) were to attempt the same 
task independantly, they would each use the standard task resolution relation:

2d10* + Ta1 >= TD        for person 1
2d10* + Ta2 >= TD        for person 2

The chance that at least one of them would succeed would be:

P(at least one success) = 1 - P(both fail) 
                        = 1 - P(person 1 fails) * P(person 2 fails)

This probability is the one that you get when Person A tries to pick a lock,
then person B tries to open it person A has failed.

Numerical example: if both persons have 30% chances of success, the probability
                   that at least one of them will succeed is

                   P(at least one success) = 1 - 0.7 * 0.7 = 51%

Common sense tells us that the probablity of success should be higher for tasks
that are attempted in cooperation (as long as the tasks can be attempted by 
more than one person at a time). How can we account for this in our rules.

A simple solution is to decrease the task difficulty by a certain amount for
each person beyond the first. Each person still makes a roll and if one person
succeeds, the task succeed. In the example above, the task resolution equations
would become:

2d10* + Ta1 >= TD - X          for person 1
2d10* + Ta2 >= TD - X          for person 2

This increases the chances of success of each person, in proportion with the
original chances of success.

The general form of the task resoltuion equation for each person is:

2d10* + Ta >= TD - (N-1)*X

where N is the number of persons attempting the task and X is the a factor
determining how easier the task is when attempted by many persons. For most
tasks, X will probably be 1.

Numerical example:

David (with STR -5) and Goliath (with STR +5) attempt to open a stuck door
(TD = 20). If they attempt individually, their combined chance of success is:

P(at least one success) = 1 - 0.96 * 0.74 = 0.71 = 29%

The task resolution equations are:

2d10* + (-5) >= 20
2d10* + (+5) >= 20

If they attempt in cooperation, their probability of success is:

P(cooperative success) = 1 - 0.96 * 0.68 = 35%

and the task resolution equations are:

2d10* + (-5) >= 19
2d10* + (+5) >= 19

(with X = 1)

This method cannot be proved to be accurate, but it is simple and gives (IMO)
much more sensible results than the methods suggested so far.

Comments? Do we adopt it?
