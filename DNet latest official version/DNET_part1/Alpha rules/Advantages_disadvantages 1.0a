Bob,

You beat me to posting the CCA pre-alpha rules by mere minutes!  Anyway, 
I like some of the stuff you've got in your version better than mine so 
I'll let it stand.  Here is what I wrote up to cover advantages and 
disadvantages for character creation.  I've included some examples and 
possible costs.  These can be modified is they are too low or high.  
Also, I'd like to encourage everyone to add to the lists.  BTW, I'm 
sending this to both CCA and Core lists.


------------------------
Advantages/Disadvantages
------------------------

In addition to skills, a character may purchase advantages and disadvantages
with his or her LE.  If a character chooses a disadvantage, he or she
receives additional LE (as given below) which can be spent freely on
advantages or other skills as the player chooses.  Some advantage and
disadvantages are listed below, with their associated costs.  The GM is
encouraged to add to or subtract advantages from this list that are
particularly relevant or inappropriate to his campaign.

Advantages
----------
Name              Cost     Description
--------------------------------------
Ambidexterous       10     Character can use either hand equally well
Disease immunity     8     Character is immune to a particular disease or
                            is generally resistant to all disease (but not
                            necessarily immune)
Double jointed      10     Character has a greater then normal range of
                            movement for one or more bodily joints.  The
                            character is able to escape most bonds and/or
                            can fit himself into tight spaces
Photographic memory 15     Character can remember details even if only seen
                            once.  The character can remember and recite long
                            lists, recall facts, memorize and remember faces,
                            names, room details, etc.  Note that this does
                            not operate automatically, but rather only when
                            the character makes an effort to remember
                            something.  (may not be necessary - see skills)
Toughness           10     Character has greater than normal resistance to
                            damage.  (all consciousness rolls made at +1,
                            extra `hit points', or whatever)
Title               15     Character is the son or daughter of a noble and is
                            in line for the title.  As such, he or she has
                            some influence with the town guard, the ruler of
                            the region, etc. and can get minor favors done
                            for him or her.  (value may change depending on
                            power of the noble parent)

Disadvantages
-------------
Name              Bonus    Description
--------------------------------------
Missing Limb        25     Character is missing an arm or leg.
Color blindness      8     Character is unable to distinguish certain colors
                            from one another.
Alcoholism          10     Self explanatory
Phobia            5-20     Character has an irrational fear of an object or
                            situation.  The bonus LE received will depend on
                            the severity of the phobia.  For example,
                            claustrophobia would be very bad for an
                            adventurer and might get 20 pts, while
                            arachnophobia (fear of spiders) might only get 5.
                            Triscadecaphobia (fear of the number 13) might
                            not warrant any.
Powerful enemy      10     The character or his family has made an enemy in
                            the past.  The enemy will always be watching for
                            the character and will take every opportunity to
                            make his or her life miserable.

Question:  Should we list phobias seperately?  I went round and round on 
this.  There are so many, but we could list some of the most interesting 
or relevant ones.  I can't remember the name for the fear of blood 
(hemaphobia?) but that would be a good one!

Hope this helps.

Robert
