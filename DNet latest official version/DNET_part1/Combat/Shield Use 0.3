Hi,

I think that this version of Shield Use should please about everyone. It you
still find it is lacking on some aspect, please say so ASAP. Thanks!

Changes:

0.1 ->  - added Alex penalty for Shield Use lower than weapon style as an
          OPTIONAL rule.
        - added two ways of compensating for the fact that someone fighting 
          with only one weapon would get a better defense for the same EP 
          spent than someone fighting with weapon and shield.
          The standard rule is a +2 bonus to defense that is added to the
          shield bonus, while in the optional rule a gradual bonus is
          added to the shield bonus.
0.2 ->  - added AGI as Talent
        - changed the rule for penalties when shield use is lower than weapon
          skill from optional to standard.
0.3 ->  - added an optional rule to make Shield Use specific to a particular
          weapon style. (Thanks to Alex for the wording!)

Shield Use
----------
EP Cost: 1
Talent: AGI
Adv. Talent: AGI
Special: +2 to defense + shield bonus
Description: This skill allows a character to use a shield in conjunction
  with an eligible weapon style to improve his defense. [The description of
  each weapon style should state if the style can be used with Shield Use].
    The use of a shield gives a bonus to defense of 2 plus the shield 
  bonus, which depends on the type of shield (from 1 for a buckler to 5 for a 
  large shield). However, if the Shield Use skill is lower than the weapon 
  skill, a penalty is applied to the weapon skill for each point of difference 
  between the weapon style and the Shield Use skill up to a maximum penalty 
  equal to the defense bonus of the shield being used.
    For example, a character with a skill of 8 in her weapon style and a
  skill of 6 in Shield Use would get a penalty of 2 on her weapon skill, giving
  her an effective weapon skill of 6. To get full advantage of her shield, she
  would have to train more with her shield to use it with greater ease. With
  a Shield Use skill of 8 or more, she would get her full weapon skill.
    The Shield Use skill can be used in conjunction with the Dodge Skill with
  the same rules that govern its use with weapon styles.

OPTIONAL: Instead of the fixed +2 defense bonus, the Shield Use skill
  gives a +1 bonus for every 5 levels, i.e. +1 at levels 1 through 5, 
  +2 at levels 6 through 10, +3 at levels 11 through 15, ...

OPTIONAL: The Shield Use skill must be tied to a particular weapon style.  
  If you want to use a shield with another weapon style, you must train up a 
  new Shield Use skill tied to that style.
