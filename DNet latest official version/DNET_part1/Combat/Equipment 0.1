Hi,

This is the beginning of an equipment section for the DNET rules. I felt that
having the weapons and armour with the combat rules was too cumbersome and not
a really good division.

You can add weapon and armour descriptions to the list. If you don't have
the stats for a particular weapon, don't worry: I will just look them up
in the Compendium of Weapons, Armour and Castles and complete the entry for
you.

NAME:   The name of the weapon.  Common usage names should be used where
        possible.  Unique names can be added to authenticate the fantasy
        background.

TYPE: (removed from the table: weapons are now classified by TYPE)
        A - articulated
        C - concussion (was: club/mace/staff)
        D - dagger/knife
        H - hammer/axe
        M - missile
        P - pole arm
        S - sword
        Sp- spear

ACTION: B - bludgeoning
        C - cutting/chopping
        S - slashing
        T - thrusting/piercing

???Do we need to distinguish between thursting and piercing?
   Is a thrusting weapon like a small sword different enough in action than
   a piercing weapon like a thin spear or arrow that we should?

IMPACT: A measure of the strength and efficiency of the weapon blow.

REACH/RANGE:  in meters

   C - close, N - near, M - moderate, F - far, E - extreme
   close    = use Reach (0 - ???)
   near     = 1-10 meters
   moderate = 1-25 meters
   far      = 10-100 meters
   extreme  = 100- meters

   Rating is Reach value in meters
     OR
   Rating is N,F or E followed by a number within the range.

MASS: in kg

LENGTH: in meters

HANDS:  Number of hands needed for normal use.

SPEED:  Used for rolling for declarations in combat. (See 6.5.1)

X.X.2 Weapon Descriptions
-------------------------

ARTICULATED
-----------

Military Flail
--------------
Two stout sticks swiveled end to end.  One stick serves
as a handle while the other thrashes about.
***description does not match with Compendium drawing
***description matches Flail in Compendium

CONCUSSION
----------

Mace
----
Maces made all of iron or steel are found wherever body armor has
been used. Their weight and hardness, especially when focused into a
spike or narrow flange, made them more effective than any type of sword.
Although usually directed against the head, a mace blow on a limb could
break a bone even if the armor was not pierced. (from me: there've been
records showing attempts to ban the mace from the field by Europeans
during the medieval times because it was so effective in staving and
buckling armor -not to mention its ability to cripple its foe if not kill
him) -these attempts to ban them failed most likely because they were so
darned effective. They can be found either one handed or two handed
(heavy maces))

DAGGERS/KNIVES
--------------

Misericorde
-----------
A dagger which was called the "dagger of mercy" with the idea
that it was used for the quick dispatch of a suffering loser; actually
it was the persuader which, presented point first to a fallen foe,
impelled him to plead for mercy and come across with a health ransom.

HAMMERS/AXES
------------

War Hammer
----------
After a a paragraph about battle axes...

A more simple, and perhaps more brutal weapon was the war-hammer.  Although
called a hammer (implying a blunt head), in fact it usually had a pointed
head which was more in the nature of a pick.  Such weaons were developed
by man primitive tribes and were comparable to stone or metal axes but
with a pointed shape.  They were adopted in Europe during the 14th century
when chain mail and other forms of armour protection were in vogue.  The
pointed head of a war-hammer proved to be an effective method of
defeating mail, provided that the point and head were thin enough, and it
could also be used to penetrate the joings of plate armour.  With a
pointed head on one side of the weapon and a blunt head on the other,
the war-hammer became a twofold weapon in so far as the blunt head could
be used to stun the opponent or unhorse him, after which the pick could
be used to defeat his armour and give the finishing blow.  The war-hammer
saw considerable use in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, but its
use declined as the armoured knight disappeared from the battlefield.

MISSILE
-------

African Throwing Irons
----------------------
A "throwing knife" used by various groups in Africa (Sudan, Bwaka,
Nigeria, and the Congo to name a few). These knives have multiple points
and come in various fancy shapes, having a center of gravity somewhere
above the handle from which the various points branch out. These tend to
be made of iron or steel and when thrown can pierce the traget "at almost
any attitude of impact". There doesn't appear to be a name for these -if
there is, it probably has a great many since it can be found all over Africa.

     Stones' "A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration and Use of
Arms and Armor" mentions these but also does not provide the native
name, additional information below is from that tome;
"...there are many special forms of knife made to be thrown that would
be of little use if handled the ordinary way. They are used
extensively in Central Africa and are of the most extraordinary
shapes. They are thrown horizontally from right to left and may hit
with any one of the branches. The trajectory is a curve that inclines
towards the right of the thrower. The maximum range is said to be
about 100 yards; at 40 to 50 is is quite accurate. "Certain travellers
relate that this arm thrown by a skillful hand can cut off a man's leg
at 20 metres. Trials at the Musee du Congo Belge showed that when
thrown from distances of 15 metres some of these throwing knives would
go through a board 15 mm in thickness" (Congo, Feb 1922 p.1) (added by
Lbeals)

Quoit (Chakram)
-----
One of the more remarkable thrown missiles was the Sikh chakram or
throwing quoit, a simple circle of metal with a sharp outer circumference,
which could be spun and then released with considerable velocity and
accuracy. (Range: 25 meters)

POLEARMS
--------

Bill
----
A long shafted weapon having its head a hooklike cutting blade with
a beak at the back.

Fauchard
----------
A larger glave with a few spurs on its unsharpened side.

Glaive
------
A big knife blade on a pole.

Guisarme
----------
A bill with two or three extra spikes

Halberd
----------
A pole axe with a longer spear part and a crescent-shaped blade.

Partisan
--------
A ontongue with a couple of curved points at the base of the blade.

Pole axe
--------
A battle-axe on a long pole.

SPEARS
------

SWORDS
------

Falchion
----------
In war, though not in tournaments, the falchion became deservedly
popular.  It was a real snickersnee -- a sword, but built more like a
knife or a cleaver, and nearly three feet long, with a single, curved
cutting edge supported by a very thick-backed blade, which gave it weight
and authority.

Shamshir
--------
Referred to by Europeans as a scimitar. For game purposes, I would group with
this weapon the Saif and the Kilij. All of these blades are curved and single
edged (except the kilij -specifics will be discussed later on) and the
distinctive middle eastern cross shaped guard. The Shamshir has a blade length
of roughly 80 cm (in a straight line -this length would be longer if the blade
were straightened) and tends to be thinner than the saif. The differences
between the shamshir and the saif is that the saif tends to be a bit shorter
and broader and can be found with a groove in the blade (I wouldn't call it a
blood groove since the usage of these particular blades are in the draw cut
style and tend not to employ stabbing motions). The Kilij is more similar to
the shamshir with the exception that the blade broadens near the tip usually
and has a straight sharpened edge on the back  of the blade (only near the
tip). The Saif is Arab in origin, the Shamshir Persian, and the Kilij Turkish.

Shotel
------
The shotel is an Ethiopean sword with a blade that extends
straightward for about 7 cm or so then curves in a crescent arc ending in
a steadily tapered point. It is double edged and the curvature is meant
to be used to reach around an opponent's shield.

Not found in the compendium (do we want to keep those)
---------------------------

Hand-and-a-half (Long)
---------------
This type of sword was generally used when dismounted,
since it demanded the use of both hands to develop the necessary force
of blow.

Oxtongue
--------
A spear with a two-edged blade with a pole for a handle.

---------
X.Y Armor
---------

Armour names and resistance value where extracted from the Palladium
"Compendium of Weapons, Armour and Castles". Resistance is an
approximate average of cut, chop, thrust and impact resistance.
