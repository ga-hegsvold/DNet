*To generate weapon lengths for non-human weapons, multiply Length by the
 Size Factor of the species for whom the weapon is designed.

Weapon Reach
------------
Wpn_Reach equals the length of a weapon in meters plus the size factor
of the wielder rounded to the nearest whole number.  (Size Factor represents
the length of the wielder's arm and can usually be chosen based on the
SR of the species in question.  However sometimes this may not be the case.
One example would be a centaur which should probably use the Size Factor
of a human as centaurs have human arms.)

   Wpn_Reach = Wpn_Length + Size_Factor_Wielder (rounded to nearest whole num)

Ex.  A human wielding a human sword:
        Wpn_Reach = (.81 + 1) = 1.81 = 2
     A hobbit wielding a hobbit sword:
        Wpn_Reach = (.465 + .574) = 1.039 = 1
     An ogre wielding an ogre sword:
        Wpn_Reach = (1.23 + 1.52) = 2.75 = 3
     A human wielding a human small sword:
        Wpn_Reach = (.16 + 1) = 1.16 = 1
     A hobbit wielding a hobbit small sword:
        Wpn_Reach = (.092 + .574) = 0.666 = 1
     A pixie wielding a pixie small sword:
        Wpn_Reach = (.010 + .0623) = 0.0723 = 0


Combat "Grid"
-------------
Now imagine a hex field where the diameter of each hex is 1 meter.
An individual member of a species takes up (Size Factor) hexes if on two
legs or (Size Factor * 2) hexes if on four legs (round to the nearest
whole number).

Ex.  A human  (Size Factor 1.0,   2 legs) takes up 1 hex.
     An ogre  (Size Factor 1.52,  2 legs) takes up 2 hexes.
     A hobbit (Size Factor 0.574, 2 legs) takes up 1 hex.
     A centaur (Size Factor 1.52, 4 legs) takes up 1.52*2 = 3 hexes
     A pixie  (Size Factor .0623, 2 legs) takes up 0 hexes.

     In the case of species that take up 0 hexes, the actual amount of
     space is a fraction.  To determine how many individuals of the
     species can occupy the hex at the same time AND still have enough
     space to fight effectively, simply take the absolute value of the SR.
     Thus abs(-10) = 10 pixies can occupy a single hex at one time.  It
     follows that a single pixie needs 1/10 of a hex to fight effectively.

A target that is within Wpn_Reach hexes away, can be hit with any weapon with
reach Wpn_Reach (assuming the attacker does not move towards the target).
A value of 0 means that the target must occupy the same hex as the
attacker (which only occurs for very small species as explained in the
preceding paragraph).
