These unarmed combat rules are meant to integrate tightly with the weapons
rules.  It should fulfill all of Guillaume's conditions.

The same targetting and damage equations are used.
There is no TEMP_INJURY as in the alpha2.0 rules.  All damage is
real, but generally light.  
It adds minimal list of Unarmed Styles to the styles table.
The most radical change is a new "Unarmed" weapon type, and treating 
the various unarmed attacks as weapons generally, but with a few extra
rules when needed, for defending against weapons, affects of holds, etc.

As always, all comments are welcome.
~John Williams


Changes in revision 3:

    Reformatted the Unarmed Attacks table to use the same format as the
    current Weapons Table.

    I adjusted damages down, considering that 2d6-2 is "dagger damage".
    Let me know if you think these are better, or what else you would recommend.

    Used Roberts suggestions for hold roll.  Defender now rolls to break hold
    instead of attacker rolling to keep hold.

    Combined Judo and Wrestling styles, for an even more minimal style list.

    I feel that Brass Knuckles should belong to Boxing style, instead of
    Close Weapon style.



-----------------
Unarmed Attacks
(Addition to Weapons Table)
-----------------
There are five types of unarmed attacks.  For game mechanics, they are
handled the same way as weapons are handled in armed combat styles.
They have an associated damage, reach, etc, just as weapons do.
An unarmed defender against a weapon gets no defence or a penalty, depending
on the fighting style being used.

+-----------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+

Unarmed weapon types
--------------------
Attacks with hands or fists do 2d6-8 IMPACT, 2d6-6 if using brass knuckles.

Kicking attacks to 2d6-6 IMPACT.  

Bashing attacks include body slams and tackles.  
IMPACT is 2d6-4.  A running start is required to do damage, 
so no IMPACT is done if you are already at close range.  
(possible to force backwards even if starting at close range)

Throws include leg sweeps and judo/wrestling throws.  IMPACT is 2d6-6 and
is not modified by STR.  Success leaves the defender prone.

Hold attacks include judo holds and wrestling pins.  
After a successful attack the defender must make a roll if he wants to
try to break the hold.  
      2d10* + STR + skill >= 10 + holder's STR + skill
The "skill" may be from any style which includes "hold" attacks.
If the hold is successful, the attacker may choose to inflict damage: 
IMPACT is 2d6-4 (+STR).

* Note about HANDS: There are holds and throws which require two hands,
and some which require no hands.  The GM may judge if a maneuver is possible
or more difficult (skill penalty) in some situations, such as if the
player has his hands bound.


---------------------
Unarmed Combat Styles
(Addition to 6.3.1)
---------------------

I would like to use a minimal list of unarmed combat styles, since it is
more in the spirit of the current weapon styles.  A well rounded martial
artist using this list would learn Karate for the hand and foot maneuvers,
Close Weapons for the usual list of Chinese peasant weapons, Judo for
the throws, Staff, and One-Handed Weapon skills.

-----------------
Misc Combat Skills
-----------------
These are a few odds and ends which can be included with the other 
miscellaneous combat skills, such as Dodge.
I think the old "Strike Pressure Point" and "KO Attack" skills can be
adequately modeled with Precision and/or Called Shots.


                    Skill Attr.        Default tasks
Skill name          Diff. Tal  Adv  NSP  TD     Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Catch Missiles      V/5   PER  AGI  10   A/10*  Catch an incoming spear
Evade Missiles      A/3   PER  AGI  6    A/10*  Dodge an incoming spear
Disarm              D/4   STR  DEX  8    D/15   Make opponent drop weapon


Catch Missiles
-------------------
Gives the character a chance to catch missiles, but only if he is defending 
against the attack.  The TD is 10 for thrown weapons, and 15 for arrows.
(Possibly more for crossbow bolts?)

Evade Missiles
-------------------
Allows character to dodge incoming missiles.  Used the same a the Dodge skill.
TD is the same as Catch Missiles.

Disarm
-------------------
This would be used in place of a normal attack to attempt to disarm the
opponent.  The success check would be:
    2d10* + skill >= TD + opponent's STR
This skill can be used by armed combatants as well, e.g. fencers.
