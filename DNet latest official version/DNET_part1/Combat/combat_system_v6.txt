Changes from version 5:
- corrected a few grammar mistakes

Things to do: (feel free to contribute)
- add a note on negative numbers, especially negative BODY and negative Armor 
  resistance
- complete the weapons list (I'll dig a bit more in the Palladium Compendium 
  when I find the time)
- add Minimum Strength for all weapons
- add Reach for all weapons
- add Bob's system for calculating weapon reach (in hexes)
- add optional methods to keep track of negative damages
- clean the armor table to reduce the number of armors and to adjust the
  armor resistances to values that fit our needs. We might want to group
  armors by types and to give base rules on how to combine different
  types of armor for the best protection
- add examples where appropriate
- add styles
- add the Awesome Toothpick of Pixie Slaughtering to the Weapons Table ;)
- add Fatigue (let's keep this one for when everything else is done, OK?)

COMBAT SYSTEM
-------------

Targeting equation
------------------

The equation used to determine if one or more successful hits have occured during 
a round is:

2d10* + Att_Sk [+ Sk_mods] >= 2d10* + [+ TD_mods] [+ Def_Sk [+ Sk_mods]]

If the left hand side is greater than or equal to the right hand side, then 
the attacker scores a hit and should proceed to determine damage.

Explained in game terms, this means that both the attacker and the defender  
should make a 2d10* roll. The attacker then add his skill to his roll, as well 
as any skill modifiers that the game master might allow or require; for 
example, he might add a +1 to his roll if he is on higher ground than the 
defender, or a -1 if he is fighting on a ledge. The defender also adds his 
skill to his 2d10* roll if he is using his active defense against this 
opponent; like the attacker, he must add the skills modifiers that the game 
master finds appropriate to the situation.

The attacker and the defender then compare the result of their rolls augmented 
by skill and modifiers. If the attacker's total is greater than or equal to the 
defender's total, then he scores one or more hits. If not, the defender has blocked 
all his attempts and is left unarmed.

Example: George the Pure is fighting Mercath the Dark on a snow covered 
         mountain. Since the terrain is treacherous, both combatants suffer 
         a -1 to  their rolls (which cancel out), but Mercath has an 
         additional +1 modifier since he is fighting from on higher side of 
         the slope. Fortunately for the cause of Good, George has a skill of 
         13, while Mercath only has a skill of 11. Since both opponents have 
         resolved to fight to the death, we can skip the phase of actions
         declaration.
         
         In the first round of combat, George rolls 19, to which is added his 
         skill of 13 and the modifier of -1, for a total of 31. Mercath only 
         rolls a for his defense 12, to which we add his skill of 11, the 
         modifier of -1 , and his bonus of +1 for being on the good side of 
         the slope, if not of the law; Mercath's total is 23. It appears 
         clearly that George's attacks have passed through Mercath's defenses 
         (31 vs 23). In the next section, we will determine how much damage 
         George has inflicted to his dark ennemy.
         
         Of course, Mercath does not only try to avoid George slashes during 
         this first round. He also tries to inflict some nasty wounds to the
         poor illuminated fool. He rolls a 7 for his attack, to which we add
         once again his skill of 11, the modifier of -1, and his bonus of +1,
         for a total of 18. George's defense roll is 8, which gives him a 
         total of 20, with his skill of 13 and the -1 modifier. George has 
         resisted to Mercath's attacks and will stay a healthy illuminated 
         fool for now.
         
OPTIONAL:
   For villains, the GM may replace the defender roll by a constant value of 
   10 to accelerate combat resolution:
   
   2d10* + Att_Sk [+ Sk_mods] >= 10 + [+ TD_mods] [+ Def_Sk [+ Sk_mods]]   
          
   Note that this makes the villains harder to hit if the attacking PC's skill 
   is less than 2 points higher than the defending villain skill. (If the PC 
   skill is 2 points higher or more, then it is easier for the PC to hit the 
   villain with a constant defense)

Determining Damage
------------------

Damage is computed by comparing the impact made by the attacker to
the resistance of the defender.

DAMAGE = IMPACT - RESISTANCE

where:

IMPACT = Weapon Impact + STR

If a weapon has not been designed to be used by humans, then its impact
can be calculated from:

   Weapon Impact = Human Weapon Impact + Species STR
      Human Weapon Impact: given in the Human Weapons table (below)
      Species STR: average strength of the species for which the weapon was
                   made (given in the species description).
                   
For example, a pixie longsword would do an impact of:
   Pixie Longsword Impact = Human Longsword Impact + Pixies average STR
                          = 2d6+4 + (-6)
                          = 2d6-2

RESISTANCE = Natural Resistance + Armor Resistance

   Natural Resistance: given in the species description
                       for new species that have a type of skin similar 
                       to that of humans, use the Species Size Rating
   Armor Resistance: as in the Armour Table (below)

Armor Resistance is always a positive value that corresponds to the type of
armor being worn.  Natural Resistance is a value representing the natural
body covering of a species (see the species description).  Natural Resistance
can be negative.  Because of this, RESISTANCE can be negative as well.

If DAMAGE is lower than 0, then it is considered to be 0. A DAMAGE of 0 or
less is considered to be just a scratch. If DAMAGE is greater than 0, then
it should be added to the INJURY heap.

INJURY = INJURY + DAMAGE

Example: George the pure has scored one or more hits on Mercath the Dark. How 
         many hits he has scored does not interest us, what we wish to know is 
         how much damage these hits have done.
         
         George is wielding a longsword, which has a base impact of 2d6+4, and
         has a strength of +3. Mercath wear a hard leather jazeraint armor 
         (resistance of 7), which is more appropriate for travel than his 
         prefered suit of plate armor.
         
         George roll 11 on for his longsword impact (2d6+4) and adds his 
         strength of +3, for a total of 14. Of these 14 points of impact
         Mercath armor absorb 7, which leaves 7 points of damage to add to
         his INJURY heap. Since he was previously unarmed, his INJURY heap is
         now equal to 7.

Unconsciousness and Death Checks
--------------------------------

Unconsciousness: 2d10* + WIL >= INJURY - BODY
Death: 2d10* + FIT >= INJURY - 2*BODY

BODY Values Table
-----------------

For the formula used to calculate those BODY values, see appendix A.

Species       BODY
------------------
Dwarf          25  (assuming STR 0)
Hobbit         20  (assuming STR -2)
Human          25
Ogre           32  (assuming STR +2)
Pixie          -1  (assuming STR -6)

Human Weapons Table
-------------------

The following weapons have been extracted from "The Compendium of
Armour, Weapons & Castles" published by Palladium Books. The
book contains many more weapons, but those listed should suffice
for the demonstration of the basic combat system.

Note: Each weapon should also have a minimum strength rating.
      When a weapon is scaled for a different species, so is the
      minimum strength rating.

----------------------------------
APPENDIX A: BODY Value Calculation
----------------------------------

I will try here to determine body values using the following assumption:

An average naked character should be able to endure 3 average longsword hits (the longsword being scaled for his species) (weapon impact = 11) before 
having a greater than 50% chance of passing out on a given unconsciousness check (note that this is a fantasy setting).

This assumption is made to ensure that combats won't be too short and
deadly but also that they won't last too long.

From John's analysis of failing a 2d10* repetitive check, we have:

     INJURY               unconscious %     unconscious %
  (or INJURY-BODY)        with one roll     with INJURY rolls
        1                     1 %               1 %
        2                     3 %               4 %
        3                     5 %               9 %
        4                     9 %              17 %
        5                    13 %              28 %
        6                    19 %              42 %
        7                    25 %              56 %
        8                    33 %              71 %
        9                    41 %              83 %
       10                    51 %              91 %

The first column is INJURY or INJURY-BODY, or the number one must roll on the
2d10* to avoid falling unconscious.  The second column is the usual
percentages we have been using, which reflect the probability of fainting
from a single blow.

The third column is the whole point of this exercise. It is the chance of
fainting from a number of blows, each of which increase INJURY by 1 point.
Since one must include the chance that the character failed one of the
earlier rolls, the probabilities go up much faster.

As we can see, a character has a 56% chance of passing out when 
INJURY = BODY + 7. If we relate this to the average impact of 3 longsword
hits, we get:

BODY + 7 = 3*(Species Average Longsword Impact)

BODY = 3*(Species Average Longsword Impact) - 7

For humans, the average longsword impact is 11 and we get BODY = 26. For 
simplicity, let's round it to BODY = 25.

This implies that the average human will have a ~50% of failing a given death 
check after 60 points of damage (~5 longsword hits).

For pixies, the average longsword impact is 2, so the BODY value will be:

BODY = 3*2 - 7 = -1

Note that these values can be an idea of what a species BODY should be. If you
want the species to be though, set the BODY a higher. If you want it to be
frail, set it lower. These formulas should be used as guidelines, not as
a way to obtain a "true" BODY value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------
APPENDIX B: Alternate damage rule
---------------------------------

Damage is computed by comparing the impact made by the attacker to
the resistance of the defender.

DAMAGE = IMPACT - RESISTANCE

where:

IMPACT = Weapon Impact + STR
   Weapon Impact = Human Weapon Impact + Species STR
      Human Weapon Impact: given in the Human Weapons table (below)
      Species STR: average strength of the species for which the weapon was
                   made.
RESISTANCE = Natural Resistance + Armor Resistance + BODY
   Natural Resistance = given in the species description
                        if not, use the species Size Rating
                       
   Armor Resistance: as in the Armour Table (below)   
   BODY: Human BODY + Species STR

If DAMAGE is lower than 0, then it is considered to be 0. A DAMAGE of 0 or
less is considered to be just a scratch.

Note: Body values are not the same in the alternate rule as in the standard
      rule. All other values are equal.

Unconsciousness and Death Checks
--------------------------------

Unconsciousness: 2d10* + WIL >= INJURY
Death: 2d10* + 5 + FIT >= INJURY

[Note: I departed from the proposed formula 2d10* + FIT >= INJURY/2
       because I wanted the chance to fail a death check before an 
       unconsciousness check to be negligible for a character with FIT 0 
       and WIL 0. The particular value of 5 has been chosen as described
       in the next section]

Human BODY Value
----------------

In mathematical terms, the assumption can be expressed as:

2d10* >= 3*DAMAGE
-> 2d10* >= 3*(11-BODY)
--> 3*BODY >= 33 - average(2d10*)
---> 3*BODY >= 23
----> BODY >= 7.67

I choose BODY = 8.

Since we want our average human to have a ~50% of dying after ~5 longsword hits, the constant in the death check equation must be:

2d10* + CONSTANT >= 5*(11-BODY)
-> 2d10* + CONSTANT >= 5*3
--> CONSTANT >= 15 - average(2d10*)
---> CONSTANT >= 5

I choose CONSTANT = 5, which gives the death check:

2d10* + 5 >= INJURY

APPENDIX C: Notes on the damage systems
---------------------------------------

Guillaume's toughts on scalability:
-----------------------------------

[These notes have not been updated to reflect changes in the text]

I won't try to justify too much my decision of scaling everything with 
strength. One could easily argue that it would be more logical to scale armor 
with size rating and I could not argue against that. I just want to express a 
few thought about the scalability issue that will help people understand why
I scaled everything with strength.

1) When we try to achieve what we call scalability, we are in fact trying
   to make pixies behave like very small humans and giants behave like very 
   large humans. For example, one basic assumption is that two pixies 
   fighting each other should be hurt as much as two humans fighting each 
   others. I personally find that this is not desirable in a fantasy 
   role-playing game: after all, why play pixies if they are nothing but small 
   humans? "Experiencing" different realities when you play different
   species is part of the fun of playing a RPG.

2) Concerning Strength, Roger rightly pointed out to me that it should be
   proportional not to mass but to muscle section, i.e. to size rating.
   While this is more accurate, I fear that this is not possible in a FRPG,
   because no large creature could support its own weight. So long for 
   giants... I therefore find that the assumption that strength is 
   proportional to muscle mass/volume is more appropriate to our fantasy 
   setting. 

3) Under the assumption that Strength was proportional to mass, scaling
   body with strength became natural.
   
4) Weapon damages have been scaled with strength also, because I felt
   that the damage potential of a weapon depends mainly on its mass
   (given that the shape is the same as the equivalent human weapon)
   
5) I changed all the weapon damages in the weapons table to 2d6 + CONSTANT
   to ease scaling and with the reasoning that it is so hard to evaluate the
   damage distribution of weapons that we might as well choose the 
   distribution that best fits our needs.

Note that with respect to comment #1, I would personnally scale Armor 
Resistance with the species Size Rating/2, even if it means that pixies
will have hard time hurting each others and that giants' fights will end 
quickly. The rationale behind such a scaling is that armor resistance is
proportional to its thickness, which is proportional to the square root of
the area (size rating/2 in our pseudo-log scale). (Undivided size rating could 
do as well, since SR and STR aren't even on the same log scale and a little 
more imprecision here won't do much wrong...)

Roger's thoughts on scalability:
--------------------------------

I feel driven to object to  this idea that pixies are
just little people and giants are big ones.  The real
world doesn't scale that way.  We have had combat schemes
that scale more naturally, but the complaint is that pixies
do no damage.  I do not find this as disagreeable as some.
From real life this is what I expect.  While there is little
reliable information recorded about pixies (8-), there are
parallel systems we can look at, e.g. cat family.  The animals
scale from house cat through sylvan cat, ocelot, puma,  panther,
lion all the way up to tiger [Leaving some out].  The relative
body dimensions change as the animal gets larger, as expected.
SO the lion and tiger have much more massive  paws and legs
relatiive to their length than the house cat.

But consider what happens in fights:

Acouple of house cats can tear into each other and leave some
scratches and nibbled ears -- if these wounds would not fester
they would not be life threatening.  A couple of big cats can
really damage each other.  A sound paw hit can knock another
cat down.  A good belly rake can disembowel.  This is lethal
combat.  Is it any wonder that there are show or loud displays
which result in one or the other backing down instead of the
wild furry combat of house cats (where only a very lucky hit actually
knocks over another cat, though a sound hit may leave the
target shaking its rattled head).

So, in dnet, I expect that two pixes going at each other will
not do comparable damage as two hwmans.  Likewise swinging
pixie swords, they will do less damage.  Giants on the other
hand, can be positively lethal even with tree trunks.  They
don't need swords when fists and clubs are enough.  [That
is why giants are often relatively low tech.  What they
get naturally or at hand is gud'nuf.]
