Combat outline rev 2
--------------------

- Overview
  - The basic premises
    - Combat is divided into rounds
    - Rounds are "atomic" -- all combatants get to attack and defend in a
      round, who attacks first is unimportant
    - Each attack/defense confrontation represents an exchange of blows

    - Combat is carried out via Styles instead of individual weapon skills.
    - Being more skilled helps you to hit and makes you harder to hit

    - Physical attacks cause impact
    - Armor reduces impact
    - Impact leads to damage
    - Damage increases injury
    - Injury leads to unconsciousness and/or death
