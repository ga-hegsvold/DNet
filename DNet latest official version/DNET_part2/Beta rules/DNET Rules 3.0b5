Hi there,

Here is an updated rules section.  The files are still split according to 
the first division.  Changes are noted in the version history.  Many of 
these changes were done because I had a couple friends read through the 
Character Creation rules who knew nothing about DNET (but are gamers) and 
try to figure out what we were talking about.  So, hopefully things are 
cleared up.

As always, comments and changes are welcome.

Robert

TO DO -> finish filling out Gifts/Foibles costs in sections 3.6 and
         8.5.1.1
      -> integrate all the rule revisions of version 2.1
      -> verify the odds in section 5.2
      -> revise the graded outcomes system to replace the multipliers 
         (TDx2, TD/5) by additive offsets (TD+X, TD-X)
      -> correct the section refering to resisting poison with an attribute
         check (where is this?)
      -> add the OPTIONAL rule for skill advancement
      -> decide if we like this format

3.0b1 (never posted)
      -> added Combat 3.0b1 into the alpha 2.0 rules
      -> made a few additional modifications in the rules, especially with
         regard to dice rolls (d10 now ranges from 0 to 9)

3.0b2 -> added Combat 3.0b2.
      -> changed the DEX definition to include fine motricity of the arms, 
         which was necessary for some combat styles and related game balance.
      -> in character creation, moved the choice of the species before the 
         choice of the career, so that it is easier to pay the EP Cost 
         associated with the species.
3.0b3 -> separated the rules from the world specifics
      -> added current versions of templates
      
3.0b4 -> Modified the magic section.  Added guidelines for spell creation
         and using other magic types.  Added templates to the template
         section.
         '+' at the beginning of the line represents changes.

3.0b5 -> Clarified the reroll method (section 2.4) description.
      -> Added sentence in section 3.2 clarifying Talent scale and species
         modifiers (I hope).
      -> added LIFT and LOAD to the new STR table and deleted the old table.
      -> moved STR table to section 8.4
      -> Rewrite of the Character Creation and Advancement section to
         include Gifts/Foibles as well as a reorganization of material.
      -> Added section 8.3 Affliction (please check this)
      -> Added recovery rules to Affliction
      -> Converted all skill costs to `EP cost' instead of `TEADV' so all
         tables and references are compatable
      -> Added Innate Gifts and Foibles section for species creation to the
         Species Template (section 8.5.1.1)
      -> Fixed minor spelling and wording problems.

SECTION 1     INTRODUCTION

-----------------
1.1 What is DNet?
-----------------

DragonNet RPG
----------------- 
DragonNet (DNet) is a Role Playing Game (RPG) developed by a group of
volunteers
over the Internet.  The game is donated to the gaming community as
described under copyright and license.  We hope that you enjoy our game.  We
encourage you to use it; to change parts that don't fit in your game
worlds; to create new monsters, spells and rules; and to share your
creative efforts with other gamers.  

Why Another RPG?
----------------
There are a lot of RPG systems out there.  Almost everybody has their
favorites.  Everybody has played AD&D (tm).  There are new games every year.
Why another one? Well, we weren't happy with the other games we've seen
for several reasons.  We felt that if we could use what we've learned from
years of gaming experience, we could develop a system that corrected the
mistakes and imbalances of other games.  We hope we've accomplished that.  

"First Kill all the Lawyers" - William Shakespeare
---------------------------------------------------

As many of you know, TSR has recently cracked down on the distribution of
user created materials for use with their AD&D (tm) game.  The letter
posted to rec.games.frp.dnd written by a TSR lawyer to a sysadmin 
caused quite a stir.  Was there a company that provided a game where 
users were encouraged to develop material for the game and use it 
freely? We couldn't find one so we decided to develop our own.

The intellectual property owned by some game company is not what makes
role-playing an enjoyable hobby.  (We argue it is their intellectual
property that causes many of the problems!) We decided to develop our own
fantasy RPG that would meet the needs of the net.community.  One that could
be enjoyed without fear of legal retaliation.  

Open Systems Development Philosophy
-----------------------------------
Unix is a popular computer operating system for two primary reasons.  One:
it's free (usually), and Two it uses an open system architecture.  Computer
operating systems and RPG's actually have a lot in common.  They are simply
a set of logical rules combined with a syntax.  This combination results in
a system where user defined modules interact.  RPG mechanics are also a set
of rules and syntax for the purpose of role playing or story-telling.  If
Unix can be successful as a free system with open system architecture,
DragonNet should be successful as a free open-system RPG.  

You already know what free means, and it's nice not to have to shell out
$20.00 for the latest RPG game.  Not to mention the continual drain on your
pocketbook for the latest supplement.  So what does open-system
architecture mean? Well simply it means that you know all the information
that was used to design the system.  You are free to tinker with the insides
of the system.  You can change it.  Improve it.  Distribute it.  Expand it.
Bend it.  Fold it.  Mutilate it.  Staple and spindle it.  

In fact we knew when we started this project we wouldn't have the time to
fully develop every aspect of a good RPG.  We hope you will take the
opportunity to carve out a portion of reality.  Study it carefully.  Ponder
it as you read through our Designer's Notes.  Write up your new material
and distribute it to the gaming world.  That is after all why we started
DragonNet.  We felt it would serve our own self interest.  We want to see
what you can develop.  

Design Philosophy
-----------------
If you want to design materials for use with DragonNet you have two
options.  You can develop unnofficial material yourself.  Or you can join
the DragonNet team.  Either way, you'll want to understand the design
philosophy we employed in creating the Dragon-Net Game.  

The Quest for Realism
---------------------
Almost all of us started RPG's with one of the early RPG systems.  It was
fun for a while, but as we progressed they lost some of their charm.
Perhaps our character had progressed to beyond the 10th level and game
balance was forever lost.  Maybe we no longer felt we had enough options,
or it seemed stupid that our fighter could dive off a 100 foot cliff into
solid rock and pick himself off the ground with relatively minor injuries.
In any event, we decided we could improve the system.  We started by
working within the systems framework.  Soon we exhausted all the
possibilities.  Many of the problems were fundamental flaws in the games
themselves unable to be easily fixed without causing major problems
somewhere else.  Next we moved on to other systems.  We tried RuneQuest(tm)
or RoleMaster(tm).  Then we moved on to "third generation" games such as
Hero (tm) or G.U.R.P.S. (tm).  Still we were unsatisfied.  We questioned why.
These games were rich with detail.  The realism we craved was there.  Why
did they lack the charm of those first RPG sessions? 

The reason we believe is that realism is not the grail RPG designers
should seek.  Adding realism for it's own sake takes away the wonder of the
game.  The mechanics begin to bog down the flow of play.  We lose the drama
inherent in the plot.  The story becomes dull.  The game unplayed.  The true
alignment principle game designers should strive for is elegance.  An RPG
can be realistic to the extent that it uses simple, fast moving mechanics.
Gritty realism is less important than plausibility.  An RPG is much like a
novel.  Many realistic games get bogged down in the mechanics.  This is as
dangerous for a GM as concentrating on technique alone would be for a
writer.  The RPG system is there to enhance the story.  The story is not a
vehicle for the RPG system.  

Simplicity vs.  Complexity
-------------------------
Within the context of an elegant game, simplicity is key.  When game
mechanics are simple and can be handled quickly they contribute to an
enjoyable role playing session.  When they are bulky, get in the way, or
require frequent die rolls or multiple table lookups we lose the sense of
action, the drama of the events happening in the game world.  Complexity is
an enemy that must be guarded against.  If we fail to be watchful it creeps
into our systems.  It destabilizes game balance and slows the play.  The
rules drive the game.  This is not what a RPG should be.  

Key Development Principles
--------------------------
Simplicity.  DragonNet should be a very simple game to play.  All the
numbers needed for play should be available on the player's character
sheet.  NPC stats should easily fit on a 3x5 card.  Table lookups should be
infrequent or non-existent, particularly during play.  Only a limited
number of dice should be used (d10 and d6).  Dice mechanics should be
similar, and there should be no more than 2 or 3 varieties.  Skill and
attribute checks should occur in basically the same manner.  Simplicity
should not however preclude the richness of systems enjoyed by experienced
players.  

Intuitive.  DragonNet should be intuitive.  Jargon and Acronymns should be
avoided.  High die rolls should be good, low rolls bad.  Game abstractions
should make sense relative to the real world.  This should not be confused
with realism.  DNet is not a detailed, gritty, realistic system.
Abstractions have a basis in reality.  As an example in AD&D (tm), hit points 
are an abstraction that includes luck, skill, endurance and physical health.
When you lose hit points in AD&D (tm) you are not necessarily taking wounds.  
This kind of abstraction should be avoided.  

Flexible.  DragonNet as a licensed game will be available for all GM's to
tinker with.  This should be encouraged, even built into the system.  Each
section of the game, Character Creation & Advancement, Skills, Combat,
Magic, etc.  should have a set of basic rules that are easy to play,
understand and use.  Each section should also have a set of Advanced Rules
that add flavor to the game.  These advanced rules should allow characters
to move seamlessly between the systems.  All advanced rules would be
strictly optional.  GM's could pick and choose among the optional rules
they will use.  

Expandable.  DragonNet is an Open-System design.  As such, it should be
easily expandable by the user.  The game design should be such that player
and GM's can easily add monsters, spells, skills, character types and
cultures without disturbing game balance or violating the integrity of the
system.  

Quality.  DragonNet should be a high quality product.  Suitable for
publication by any of the major game publishing companies.  It should
include quality color artwork, be well written and meticulously edited.  It
should be made available through anonymous ftp as text, postscript, and
through www as hypertext formats.

----------------------
1.3 Terms and Concepts
----------------------
To play a DragonNet game, there are a few terms that must be known.  
We've tried to keep terminology to a minimum, but it inevitably creeps 
in.  Where we have specific terms for RPG constructs, we have tried to 
make them as intuitive as possible.


1.3.1 Talent
------------
Talent describes a character's natural ability in a particular area.  A 
character's strength talent is a measure of their ability to lift loads, 
carry weight and deal damage in combat.  Other systems refer to a 
characters natural abilities as attributes or abilities.  We use the term 
Talent (though you may find attribute in certain places in the draft rules).


1.3.2 Training
--------------
Training is the amount of learned experience a character has in a given 
skill or area.  This includes formal and informal education, obtained at a 
university or the school of hard knocks.  A character gains training 
through practice, study and use of skills.  Experience can be used to 
increase a characters training level in a skill.

1.3.3 Skill
-----------
Skill is the effectiveness of a character in a particular area.  Skill 
includes both the characters natural talent and his level of training.  

[Skill = Talent (Ta) + Training (Tr)]

DragonNet is a skill based system, so most of a character's abilities 
will be described as skills.  

1.3.4 Heaps
-----------
Heaps are numeric values that start at 0 and go up.  High Heap values are
bad and low Heap values are good.

Some Heaps used in DNet:
   Encumbrance
   Injury
   Fatigue

Heaps work similarly to Task Difficulties (See Skills), except that they 
are variable.  For example, when a character takes sufficient injury, he makes

a survival check by rolling dice and comparing the result (modified by 
appropriate Talents, skills or Traits) to his Injury heap.

***************************************************************************
SECTION 2     DICE

---------
2.0 Tasks
---------
Characters in roleplaying games are constantly trying to do things.  
Picking pockets, casting spells, haggling the price of an item with a 
shopkeeper, etc.  Whenever a character attempts to do something, it is 
referred to as a Task.  DragonNet uses the same consistent format for all 
tasks.  Whether you are swinging a sword, picking a lock, or fast-talking 
a town guardsman, you will always use the same game mechanics.

-------------------
2.1 Task Resolution
-------------------
Tasks are resolved by rolling dice, adding the characters skill or 
ability to the die roll, and comparing the result to a Task Difficulty.  
If the die roll plus the ability is greater or equal than the difficulty, 
the task succeeds.  If it is less, the attempt fails.  Optionally, the Game 
Master may use the amount by which the attempt fails or succeeds to 
determine the degree of success or failure.

Two ten sided dice are rolled for task resolution.  DragonNet uses an
open-ended die roll method designated 2d10* (See re-roll method below).  An
initial roll of 0 will be considered an auto-failure with rules for
circumstances where an auto-failure should not apply.  

-----------------    
2.2 Weapon Damage
-----------------
Six sided dice are used for weapon IMPACT.  Each weapon has an IMPACT 
of 2d6+X, where X generally ranges from -2 to +14.

--------------
2.3 Experience
--------------
Experience Points can be awarded with Experience Dice (d6).  Some GM's may 
not like this level of randomness, and are free to set EP's as a fixed 
amount as outlined in the section on experience.  In that case the dice 
range can be used as a guide.

-----------------
2.4 Reroll Method
-----------------
For Task Resolution, DragonNet uses two ten-sided dice.  Unless otherwise
stated, it is assumed that these dice are numbered from 0-9, not 1-10 (the `0'
on the die actually counts as zero, not ten).  Therefore, a roll of 2d10 will
generate numbers from 0-18.

Any roll of doubles, except double 0s, will generate a reroll.  All rolls
are summed together and rerolls continue for all doubles rolled except
double 0s.  A roll of double 0s during a reroll ends the roll and 0 is
added to the current total.  Using this method is denoted as 2d10*
throughout the rules.

Example: 1st roll  7 + 7 = 14 
         reroll    2 + 1 =  3 
 
Thus, the outcome of the 2d10* roll is 14 + 3 = 17.  
 
Example: 1st roll  6 + 6 = 12 
         reroll    9 + 9 = 18 
         reroll    5 + 5 = 10 
         reroll    8 + 9 = 17     
 
Thus, the outcome of the 2d10* roll is 12 + 18 + 10 + 17 = 57.  
 
Example: 1st roll  0 + 0 = automatic failure!

Example: 1st roll  8 + 8 = 16
         reroll    0 + 0 =  0 and rerolls stop

Thus, the outcome of the 2d10* roll is 16 + 0 = 16.

***************************************************************************
SECTION 3     CHARACTER CREATION

------------------------------------
3.1 Steps for Completing a Character
------------------------------------
Following is a basic outline describing the steps involved in creating a
character for DragonNet.  Each of these steps will be detailed in the
following sections.

Step 1: Ask your GM for the genre of the game (Realistic, Heroic or Highly
        Heroic).  Use this genre to determine the number of Talent Points
(TPs)
        your character will start out with and use them to buy starting
Talents
        (section 3.3.1).  If your GM prefers, you may roll randomly for
starting
        Talents (section 3.3.2).

Step 2: Ask your GM for the Experience Level of his campaign.  With the
        Experience Level use the table in section 3.4 to determine how
        many Experience Points (EPs) your character begins with. 
(Alternatively,
        your GM may simply assign EP to you instead of having you use the
        table).

Step 3: Select a Species

        Species that can be used as PCs will indicate this in their
        encyclopedia template.  Species will also have a value in their
        Template called Cost.   Human Cost = 0.  All other species have a
        number relative to humans.  Thus if a species has more negatives
        than positives, it will have a negative Cost.  If a species has
        more positives than negatives, it will have a positive Cost.  Refer to
        individual species descriptions in that part of the rules.

        Subtract Cost from EP.

        - Species will list +/- next to their talents.  The +/- represent
          how much better or worse the species average is in that talent
          compared to human.  For instance, if an Elf lists +5 PER, this
          means that the average Elven Perception is +5 greater than the
          human average.  Species Talent modifiers cannot range higher than
+5.
          Add these Talent modifiers to your character's Talents.

Step 4: Select a Career if you wish.  See section 3.5 for more details.
        
Step 5: Select Gifts and/or Foibles if desired (see section 3.6)

        Gifts have a positive EP Cost.
        Foibles have a negative EP Cost.

        Subtract these Costs from EP.

Step 6: Select a skill for the character (see Chapter 4).  If the character
has
        chosen a career, the skill should fall within one of the EP groups in
which
        the character has some EP remaining.

Step 7: Note the Skill Cost (1-5 EP per skill level)

Step 8: Decide what level of Training you want your character to have with
        the skill.

Step 9: Using the Skill Cost and the Desired Training Level, calculate
        the cost by using the value from the skill acquisition costs table
(section
        3.4) or by using the shortcut formula.  Subtract this number from an
EP
        group to which the skill belongs (Career EP or non-Career EP).

Step 10: Repeat steps 6-9 until EP = 0 for all groups or you wish to stop
        purchasing skills.
        Record unused EP on your character sheet for later use.

-----------
3.2 Talents
-----------
In the DragonNet system, a character is defined by ten primary Talents.  
These are described hereafter and have been split into two categories - 
(1) physical and (2) mental.

Physical: Fitness, Agility, Manual Dexterity, Strength, Beauty
Mental:   Intelligence, Will Power, Perception, Aura, Psyche
 
Human Talents are in the range -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5.
However, Talents are open-ended on both the negative and positive side.  It
should also be noted that different player species may have modifiers to some
Talents, thus moving them above or below the `normal human' range of -5 - +5. 
A Talent score of +5 is considered to be five times as high as a Talent score
of 0.

3.2.1 Physical Talents
----------------------

Agility (AGI)
-------
Agility represents body control (static and motive) and connectivity.
It includes balance, rhythm, and flexibility.
 
Beauty (BEA)
------
Beauty simply defines how good a character looks in terms of sheer 
physical attractiveness.  It can be particularly important when you have 
no time to argue or express yourself but must still leave a good 
impression.
 
Manual dexterity (DEX)
----------------
Manual dexterity includes hand-eye coordination, fine motricity of the 
arms and hands, and sensitivity of touch.
 
Fitness (FIT)
-------
Fitness is an indicator of bodily health (including resistance to 
hardship, injury and disease) and metabolic efficiency.  Running for 
two hours without halt is a good example of a fitness related 
activity.
 
Strength (STR)
--------
Strength is a rating of physical power, both in its instantaneous 
explosive expression and in its prolonged and measured form.


3.2.2 Mental Talents
--------------------

Aura (AUR)
----
Aura is the non-tangible complement to beauty.  It represents a 
character's ability to impress, influence, seduce, command and lead 
people.  Qualities such as natural charisma, personal magnetism, and 
sex appeal are greatly influenced by a character's aura.
 
Intelligence (INT)
------------
Intelligence encompasses memory, analytical and reasoning ability, and 
speed of thought.  A high intelligence indicates a natural aptitude for 
the generation, retention, and understanding of linear thought.
 
Perception (PER)
----------
Perception includes alertness and observational acuity.  A character with 
a high perception score has keen senses and is less likely to be 
surprised by unexpected developments.
 
Psyche (PSY)
--------------
Psyche is the emotional counterpart to intelligence.  It rates a 
character's ability to engage in creative, intuitive, spiritual and 
transcendental thought.  Amongst other things, Psyche enables interaction 
with the supernatural, including the gods, the spirit of Nature, and the 
mysteries of the universe.
 
Willpower (WIL)
--------------
Willpower is an indicator of self discipline (determination and persistence) 
and mental fortitude (resistance to influence, pain and stress).


----------------------
3.3 Generating Talents
----------------------
The first step in the character creation process is to generate Talents.
There are two methods for doing this -- buying Talents with a point-cost
method (3.3.1) or randomly rolling for Talents (3.3.2).


3.3.1 Buying Talents
--------------------

A character begins with a number of Talent Points (TP) divided evenly into 
the two attribute categories, i.e.  one half of the TPs must be spent on
Talents for Physical attributes and the half on Talents for Mental attributes.

The number of starting TP depends on the genre set by the Game Master:

Highly Heroic -> 20 TP
              -> Average Talent = +2

Heroic        -> 10 TP
              -> Average Talent = +1

Realistic     -> 0 TP
              -> The adventurer is just as good as a normal human
                 (Average Talent = 0)
 
The Talent of each attribute is purchased at a cost equal to the Talent value.
For example, a Talent of +5 in Strength costs five Talent Points, while a
Talent of -2 would yield two Talent Points to be spent on other Attributes.

A character cannot have a Talent over +5 or below -5 before the Species'
modifiers are applied.

OPTIONAL: When creating a character, a player has the choice to distribute
          starting TP into the two categories using any of the following
          breakdowns: (Physical/Mental)
                            60% / 40% (6 TP / 4 TP)*
                            50% / 50% (5 TP / 5 TP)
                            40% / 60% (4 TP / 6 TP)

          *Cost in parenthesis are given for the Heroic genre.
          
OPTIONAL: At least half of the TP must be used when buying Talents in a
          category.  Left over TP can be converted to Experience Points using
          a 1 to 10 conversion ration (1 TP = 10 Experience Points).  The
converted
          points can only be applied to skills whose primary attribute is
          a member of the category h(physical or mental) from which the points
were
          converted.

3.3.2 Rolling for Attribute Talents
-----------------------------------
To generate values in the -5 to +5 range, the basic die roll method is to 
roll 2d6 then subtract 7 (i.e.  2d6-7).  This methods gives a -5 to +5 
distribution that looks like a linear climbing ramp followed by a linear 
falling ramp, and has a mean of 0.  The odds of rolling each extreme (-5 or
+5) 
are 1 chance out of 36 for each roll.  On ten rolls, the probability of 
having at least one +5 is about 25%.

OPTIONAL: 
A simple variant to the method presented above is to roll more dice than 
needed and keep only the best.  For example, one could roll 3d6 and keep only 
the two best, ignoring the result of the lowest dice (this result is NOT 
added).  The use of this method is left to the discretion of the Game Master.

Once the die rolling method has been chosen (by the Game Master), several 
procedures can be applied to generate a character's attributes.  A few are:

1) Make a roll for each attribute in order.

2) Make ten rolls and assign the results to the attributes as you wish.

3) Make eleven or more rolls, drop the lowest and arrange to taste.

3.4 Starting Experience Points
------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experience  |      |  Career  |     Maximum Starting Tr Level (Optional)
Level       |  EP  |    EP    | Adv cost=   1      2      3      4       5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting    |  250 |  193/82  |            10      8      6      4       2
Moderate    |  500 |  385/165 |            12     10      8      6       4
High        | 1000 |  770/330 |            16     14     12     10       8
Very High   | 2000 | 1540/660 |            24     22     20     18      16
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Experience Level
   The average experience level of characters in the GM's campaign.
   Starting:   Characters have few skills.  Difficult skills have low Tr
               levels.
   Moderate:   Characters have some skills.  Difficult skills have moderate
               Tr levels.
   High:       Characters have many skills.  Difficult skills have high Tr
               levels.
   Very High:  Characters have lots of skills.  Difficult skills have very
               high Tr levels.

EP
   The number of EP associated with the campaign's Experience Level.  EP are
   used for selecting a species, buying gifts and foibles, and buying skills.
   
   The EP values listed represent the experience points that a character has
   accumulated throughout his lifetime.  It quantifies the  achievements the 
   character has made since childhood and the experience the character has 
   obtained from those achievements.

   GMs are encouraged to assign their own EP values if those listed do not
   fit with the GM's personal rate of awarding experience.

Career EP
   If a player decides to select a Career for his character then EP is
   increased by 10% (rounded up).  However, in order to receive this bonus,
   70% of EP must be devoted to skills within the domain of the Career.
   A given career may further specify to which skills portions of that 70%
   must be devoted.  The remaining 30% of EP can be used to freely select any
   other skills, including additional career skills.
   
   The "Career EP" column in the table gives the number of experience points 
   that must be spent on career skill (the number preceeding the slash) and
the
   number of experience points that can be spent on other skills (the number
   after the slash).

Maximum Starting Training Level (Optional)
   Listed as an optional rule to control how much Training a player can
   acquire for a skill at character creation.  It simulates the fact that at
   lower Experience Levels a character has not had enough time to develop
   skills to high levels of mastery.  In particular, harder skills would not
   have been developed as much as the easier skills.  If GMs have no problem
   with characters beginning with skills starting out at any Tr level, then
   they can ignore this option.

   The numbers in the table indicate the maximum training level a character
   may advance a given skill to start with.  For example, if a character were
   just starting out, and wanted to learn Cooking (a low cost skill costing 1
EP
   (Adv cost) - see the skill lists in the `World' book, Chapter 2 - Skills
for
   more information) and Armourer (a more difficult skill costing 4 EP), he
   could advance Cooking to a maximum level of 10 (at a cost of 55 EP - please
   see Skill Acquisition Costs table below), and Armourer to a maximum level
of 4
   (at a cost of 40 EP).

The following table can be used to look up the EP cost for advancing a skill
from a Training level of 0 to the desired training level in one step.  This
table is most useful when creating a character and buying skills for the first
time.

Skill Acquisition Costs
 Shortcut Formula: EP needed = (Desired Tr) * (Desired Tr + 1) * (EP Cost of
skill) / 2

-----------------------------------------------
Desired  |      Skill Advancement Cost

3.5 Careers
-----------

3.5.1 Career Bonus
------------------
Character's who embark upon a career have some small advantages over those
who take a more generic approach.  Specifically, upon creation, Characters
receive a 10% bonus to Experience Points (EP's) provided at least 70% of their
EPs are spent on skills in their career areas.  30% of their starting skill
EPs may be spent on any skills.  There is no bonus for choosing a career once
play begins.

Choosing a career does not limit a character to a certain set of skills
exclusively, nor prevent a character from gaining skills outside their career
areas.  The character will simply have more starting EPs to spend on skills
within their career areas.  There is nothing to prevent, for example, a
Soldier character from learning skills from the Magic area at some later time,
provided he has the needed EP.

3.5.2 (Example) Career Table

***************************************************************************
SECTION 4     SKILLS

A skill is an acquired ability, one that a character learns.

--------------------
4.1 Skill Competency
--------------------
A skill is composed of two parts:
   1) Talent   (Ta)  (determined by the attribute relevant to the skill)
   2) Training (Tr)  (determined by experience with the skill)

Thus, Skill = Talent (Ta) + Training (Tr)

Skill    Competency   Description
------   ----------   -----------           
 Tr=0    No Skill     (A character who has no training with a skill.)
 <= 0    Novice       (A character who has Training but low Talent.)
 1-5     Apprentice   (A character being taught a skill.)
 6-10    Journeyman   (A character who has learned his skill.)
11-15    Craftsman    (A character who is proficient with his skill.)
16-20    Adept        (A character who is an expert with his skill.)
21-25    Master       (A character who is a master with his skill.)
 26+     Grandmaster  (A character who is legendary with his skill.)

All skills confer the following abilities:

 - A character who has Tr > 0 in a skill can recognize the use of that skill
   by another.

 - A character who has Tr > 0 in a skill can recognize the Competency level
   of another person with the same skill.

 - A character can determine the actual skill level of another if the
   character's skill level is greater than the other person's.

---------------
4.2 Skill Costs
---------------
All skill costs are measured in Experience Points.  The higher the number
of Experience Points, the harder the skill is to learn and master.

Skill Difficulty   Base EP Cost
----------------   ------------
Trivial            1 EP
Easy               2 EP
Average            3 EP
Difficult          4 EP
Very Difficut      5 EP

--------------------------
4.3 Untrained Penalty (UP)
--------------------------
When a character attempts a task for which he has not been trained 
(Skill Competency is 'No Skill', see section 4.1), or to which no skill
is related, he suffers an "Untrained Penalty".

Some skills will have a special UP of Impossible.  This indicates that
the skill cannot be attempted when Skill Competency is 'No Skill'.

BASIC RULE: The UP is equal to 5 for all tasks.

OPTIONAL RULE:
The UP is generally equal to 5 but can be changed by the game master.
The game master may set a higher UP for a task that is normally
performed using a skill requiring a lot of knowledge or practice
(Difficult and Very Difficult skills).  In the same way, the game master
may reduce or eliminate the UP for tasks that are primarily based on 
attributes (ex: resisting a poison), or that do not benefit much from 
knowledge or practice (Trivial and Easy skills).
               
As a guideline, a UP of twice the Base EP Cost (see section 4.2) of
the related skill is suggested for tasks that are normally performed
using a skill.
      
   UP = 2 * Base EP Cost

---------------------
4.4 Skill Advancement
---------------------
To increase a skill to its next training level, a character must spend
a number of experience points equal to the next training level times
the Base EP Cost (see section 4.2) of the skill.  

Skill Advancement Formula:  EP Cost = Next Tr * Base EP Cost

For example, if Argis the ranger wants to increase his tracking skill 
(Base EP Cost = 4 EP) from training level 8 to training level 9, he
must spend:

EP Cost = Next Tr * Base EP Cost = 9 * 4 EP = 36 EP

For those who prefer not to use the formula, a table is provided.

Skill Advancement Costs Table:
---------------------------------------------
 Next |           Skill Difficulty
  Tr  |   T       E       A        D      VD

***************************************************************************
SECTION 5     TASKS

A Task is a situation in which a character applies his abilities to
accomplish some action.  A character may use his Talent or a skill when
attempting to resolve the Task.

-------------------
5.1 Task Resolution
-------------------
The process of resolving a Task is called Task Resolution.  It is done via
a roll of the dice.  The applicable Skill is then added to the die roll and
the
result must be greater than or equal to the Task Difficulty  set by the GM.
Thus the standard Task Resolution Formula is:

Formula: 2d10* + Skill >= TD

where: 2d10* = Standard Dice Roll
  and: Skill = Ta + Tr
  and: TD    = Task Difficulty

If situational modifiers reduce a Task Difficulty to zero or less, a Task
Resolution roll is not required; the outcome is an automatic success.  

Similarly, and especially in non-crisis situations, a GM may waive the
requirement for a task resolution roll when a character's skill rating is
within 5 points of the Task Difficulty rating e.g., Skill 6, TD 10.

------------------------------
5.2 Relative vs Absolute Tasks
------------------------------

Tasks can be divided into two categories:
   Relative -- Those whose difficulty are relative to the Talent of the
               character attempting the Task.
   Absolute -- Those whose difficulty are constant regardless of Talent.

Lifting weight is an example of a Relative Task, while picking a lock is
an example of an Absolute Task.

Establishing Task Difficulties for Absolute Tasks is done by
determining what the difficulty of the task would be for a minimally 
trained average character (Ta = 0, Tr = 1).  The same Task Difficulty is 
then used by all characters no matter what their skill is.  Absolute 
Tasks use the standard Task Resolution Formula from section 5.1.

For Relative Tasks, the Task Difficulty is established as a function of
the Talent of the character attempting the Task.  For example, the Task
Difficulty for lifting 120 kg is relative to the maximum weight a
character can lift, which is in turn relative to the Strength Talent of
the character.  Thus, a character with a maximum Lift of 50 kg faces
the same Task Difficulty when trying to lift a weight of 100 kg as a
character with a maximum Lift of 20 kg trying to lift a weight of 40 kg.

When a character is attempting a Relative Task, he must use a slightly 
modified Task Resolution Formula:

with a skill:    2d10* + Tr >= TD
without a skill: 2d10* - UP >= TD  

where UP is the "Untrained" Penalty (see section 4.3).

As you will notice, Talent is not used in the Relative Task Resolution
Formula; this is because the Task Difficulty already takes Talent into
account.

A rule of thumb to use to determine if a task is Relative or Absolute is
to decide if the task is quantitative or qualitative by nature.  Examples
of quantitative tasks are: lifting 100 kg, running at 2 meters per second;
tasks of a qualitative nature would be: climbing a wall, picking pockets,
or playing chess.  If the Game Master has a hard time deciding if a task is 
Absolute or Relative, he should treat it as an Absolute task, which will 
simplify calculations and accelerate game play.

---------------------
5.2 Task Difficulties
---------------------
To aid the GM in determining task difficulties, the following task 
difficulties have been established relative to what an average 
character (Ta = 0) with minimal training in a skill (Tr = 1) can
accomplish.  Therefore, the values were derived from the following 
task resolution formula:

2d10* + 1 >= TD

Thus, when assigning a difficulty to a task, the Game Master should set
the Task Difficulty as if the task was being attempted by a Ta = 0, Tr = 1
character.  The Game Master should not base the difficulty on the skill
level of the character attempting the task.  In other words, figure out what
the task is like, then use the table below to find the description that
best fits the Task.  With this description, use the TD value listed.

For example, climbing a moss covered wall by someone with Ta = 0, Tr = 1
could be described as tricky.  Tricky is listed under the "Could also be
described as" column for Difficult.  The TD associated with a Difficult
Task is 15.  Thus no matter what the Skill of a character attempting to
climb a moss covered wall, the Task Difficulty is 15.

If a character with Skill 3 in Climb Walls attempts to climb the moss
covered wall, he uses the formula: 2d10* + 3 >= 15.

If a character with Skill 10 in Climb Walls attempts to climb the moss
covered wall, he uses the formula: 2d10* + 10 >= 15.

------------------------------------------------------
Description      TD  Odds   Could also be described as
------------------------------------------------------
Easy..............5  97%    Routine, Simple, Trivial
Average..........10  75%    Engaging, Fair, Intermediate
Difficult........15  32%    Difficult, Tough, Tricky
Very Difficult...20  9%     Challenging, Demanding, Tasking, Vexing
Extremely Diff...25  4%     Exacting, Formidable, Punishing

Extreme..........30  2%     Ballistic, Limit
Crushing.........35         Backbreaking, Monumental
Herculean........40         Epic, Staggering, Superhuman
Gargantuan.......45         Stupefying
Titanic..........50         Awesome

Unbelievable.....60         Impossible
Inconceivable....70         Shattering
God-like.........80         Legendary, Mythic
Immortal.........90         Celestial, Eternal
Cosmic..........100         Transcendental

-----------------------------------------
5.4 Task Resolution when no skill is used
-----------------------------------------
If a character attempts a task for which he does not possess a skill or to
which no skill is related, he uses (Ta - UP) in place of Skill and the Task 
Resolution Formula becomes:

Formula:  2d10* + (Ta - UP) >= TD

where UP is the "Untrained" Penalty.

UP is generally equal to 5 but see Section 4.3 for GM options.

Note: Attributes checks are conducted using this method, since they do not
involve a skill.  Because it is sometimes difficult to tell if a task could
be done using a skill or not, it is the responsibility of the GM to set an
UP of 0 for what he feels to be a true "Attribute Check".  An example of a
true attribute check would be resisting poison to which a character's
Fitness would be applied using the formula 2d10* + FIT >= Poison Strength.

-----------------------------------
5.5 Contested Skill Task Resolution
-----------------------------------
Formula: 2d10* + Skill^ >= TD + Opponent's Skill^

^If contestant is not using a skill (generally because he is untrained), 
replace Skill with (Ta - UP).

-----------------------------
5.6 Composite Task Resolution
-----------------------------
There is a TD for the task as a whole.   A roll is made at an effective
skill equal to the sum of his skills which are involved in the task against
that TD.   If the roll succeeds, the task succeeds.   If the roll fails, the
task fails.

---------------------
5.7 Combining efforts
---------------------
When many characters unite their strength, intelligence, etc.  to accomplish
a Task, they are often more efficient than if they were trying to
accomplish the Task independently.  In such a situation, the success of the
attempted Task is obtained by having each character roll independently
against the Task Difficulty.  The TD is lowered by 1 for every character
working on the Task beyond the first.  The Task Resolution Formula for each
character is therefore:

2d10* + Skill >= TD - (N-1)

where N is the number of characters attempting the task.

The Task is successful if at least one of the characters makes his roll.

The GM must decide, based on the Task, if more than one character can
attempt the Task.  If he decides that more than one character can attempt 
the Task, he must then decide the maximum number of characters that can 
take part in attempting the Task.

-----------------------------------
5.8 Graded outcomes (OPTIONAL RULE)
-----------------------------------
Graded outcomes
---------------
Bonus:   Total greater than 2 x TD
Success: Total greater than TD
Partial: Total greater than (TD - 3)
Fail:    Total less than (TD - 3)
Mishap:  Total less than TD/5

Outcome definitions
-------------------
BONUS - a really good result which surpasses normal expectations
(occasionally to excess)
SUCCESS - a successful outcome which achieves the desired result
PARTIAL - a success, but far less than perfect or with unwanted conditions or
secondary results.  If a result for a partial outcome is not obvious, the DM
should treat it as a failure.
FAIL - an unsuccessful attempt
MISHAP - a particularly bad failure that exposes the character to additional
misfortune, harm, penalty or confusion.  If nothing seems easy to conclude as
a result of a mishap, the DM should either consider increasing the
difficulty of subsequent actions made "in recovery" or treat the outcome as
a failed attempt.

Example: Shardra the Ranger has Tracking 4.  She tries picking up the trail
of a wounded bandit.  The DM decides that this will be hard, as it's been
raining.  The formula becomes -

2d10* + 4 >= 15

If Shardra's player gets a total of 30 or higher she gets a bonus.  Not only
does Shardra pick up the trail, she also picks up the overlying trail of a
pursuing wolverine!

If she rolls 15-29, it's good.  Shardra picks up the bandit's trail.

If she rolls 12-14, it's a partial.  Shardra picks up the trail just long 
enough to figure the general direction taken by the bandit.

If she rolls 7-11, it's bad.  Shardra cannot pick up the trail because it's
been
washed away.

If she rolls 1-6, it's a mishap.  Shardra picks up a trail but fails to see a
deception and wanders into an ambush.
 

***************************************************************************
SECTION 6     COMBAT

----------------
6.1 Introduction
----------------

"...  violence is the last refuge of the incompetent." Isaac Asimov

When other means of achieving objectives have failed, the party of adventuring
characters may find themselves in an encounter that leads to combat.    Combat
can take many forms including melee, archery, arcane, etc.   Good combat
rules should cover all those situations, while being simple enough not to
prevent the players from having fun.

Like everything else in the DragonNet system, combat rules seek to achieve a
balance between realism, simplicity and heroism.   In a completely realistic
system, serious wounds often prove fatal and the game master has to take great
care not to create a situation where combat is unavoidable.   At the opposite,
in a heroic system where the characters can endure extreme wounds without
flinching, combat often becomes the preferred mean to resolve situations of
conflict.   In our vision, combat should not limit character development by
ending it whenever it happens, nor should it prevent it by being a universal
solution to all problems.   Therefore, the DragonNet combat system is deadly
enough that characters won't always seek combat as the solution to their
problems, but not so deadly as to make the characters flee each time brute
force is required.

------------------
6.2 Basic Premises
------------------

6.2.1 The Combat Round
----------------------

As in many RPG system, combat in DNET is resolved by dividing its duration
into rounds.   During a round, each character can perform one action:
attacking
an opponent, casting a spell, reloading a bow, etc.   Each combat round
represents six seconds of action, giving ten rounds per minute.

During a combat round, each protagonist will get to accomplish one action,
without consideration for who acts first or last.   Each attack/defense
confrontation is in fact an exchange of blows and the damage inflicted by the
protagonists upon each other is the summation of the effects of each
individual blow.   It is therefore perfectly possible for two combatants to
finish off each other in the same round, giving a situation similar to the
final combat scene in the movie "Excalibur".

6.2.2 Combat Styles
-------------------

There is more to combat than just swinging a weapon; most of the reflexes that
make a good fighter have more to do with the way he uses his weapon than with
the particular weapon used.   The skills your character has to learn to be a
proficient fighter are thus named combat styles.   The primary style for a
fighter with military training would probably be "Weapon and Shield".   A
northern barbarian wielding a claymore would most often use the "Two-handed
weapon" style.   A magic oriented character would probably opt for a low cost
style such as "Staves", giving him basic combat abilities while letting him
focus most of his efforts on magic lore.

As your character gains experience, he can advance in one or more combat
style.   Since combat styles are used for both attack and defense, improving
them makes you both harder to hit and better at hitting your opponents.

6.2.3 Impact, Damage and Injury
-------------------------------

When you hit an opponent with a weapon, you generally intend to cause him some
physical damage.   The DragonNet system uses a specific procedure with its
associated terminology to calculate this damage; the basics of the damage
calculation procedure are exposed here, so that you can better understand
the rest of the system.   The complete procedure will be described in detail
later in the combat chapter.

Every physical attack is said to cause an IMPACT.   For example, a hit with
bastard sword made by an average human causes 2d6+4 points of IMPACT.   If the
target is wearing armor, part of the attack's IMPACT is absorbed by the armor,
while the remaining part, if any, constitutes the true physical DAMAGE, which
is added to the target's INJURY heap.   If the target suffers too much
INJURY, i.e.  more than what is BODY allows, he will pass out and eventually
die.

6.2.4 Combat Round Sequence
---------------------------

Most gamers hate it when the mechanics of combat system take more time than
the actions and tactical decisions of the characters.   In other words, the
mechanics should not slow down the combat flow and bring down the climactic
tension.   The combat round sequence outlined here and described more fully
later in the text will generally be most effective one for smooth combat
resolution.

The combat round begins with the declaration phase, during which each player
announces the actions of his character(s) and the game master states the
actions of the non-player characters (NPC).   The order of the declaration can
be arbitrary or determined by rolling for initiative.   In both cases, it is
advantageous to declare last, since you can decide the actions of your
character in regard of what others have announced.

After all actions have been declared, the resolution phase begins.   No
particular order is required, as all actions are considered to be simultaneous
and every character is assured that he will have a chance to attempt its
planned actions.   For attacks, resolution is divided in two steps: the
attacker
first attempts to hit the defender in a contest of skills; if he is succesful,
damage is calculated using the procedure outline above (sec.  6.2.3).

At the end of each combat round, after all actions have been resolved,
characters that have been wounded during the round must check to see if they
remain conscious and alive.

-------------------
6.3 Combat Sequence
-------------------

This section explains in detail how combat is resolved in the DragonNet 
system.  To this end, a game situation leading to combat is developped as the 
rules are presented.

Combat is broken down into rounds.   Each round is considered to last 6
seconds.
All actions that occur within a round are independent of each other and are
considered to take place at the same time.   Thus it is always possible for
two
combatants to strike each other down in the same round.

Within a combat round, attacks and defenses are viewed as a passe d'armes, not

as individual strokes.

Game situation: Neila and Jalik have been cautiously exploring the ruins
  of a temple of Hekari, an almost forgotten deity of darkness and disease,
  in the hope of lifting a curse that as been plaguing a pixie community
  for centuries.  As they are about to despair, their efforts are rewarded
  by a hollow sound from a flagstone reveals a hidden passage.  After
  doublechecking their torches and pushing the stone safely aside, they
  engage in the the shadows of a stairway.

The characteristics and appropriate skills and equipment of the two characters

are given here for reference purposes.

Neila (Bob's character)
Physical Talents: AGI: 2; BEA: 1; DEX: -2; FIT: 2; STR: 3
Mental Talents:   AUR: 0; INT: 1; PER: 0;  PSY: 1; WIL: 2
BODY: 15
Combat skills:
                          Ta + Tr = Skill
  One Handed W.  & Shield: 2  + 6  = 8      Attack: 8  Defense: 9+2+4 = 14
  Dodge:                  2  + 7  = 9      Defense: 9+4 = 13
Equipment:
  War Hammer (IMPACT = 2d6+4)
  Kite (defense bonus = 4)
  Soft leather bezainted armor (RESISTANCE = 6)

Jalik (Roger's character)
Physical Talents: AGI: 3; BEA: 0; DEX: 2; FIT: 1; STR: 0
Mental Talents:   AUR: 1; INT: 1; PER: 2; PSY: 0; WIL: 0
BODY: 15
Combat skills:
                Ta + Tr = Skill
  Dual Weapons: 3  + 6  = 9      Attack: 9+2 = 11  Defense: 9-1 = 8
  Dodge:        3  + 5  = 8
Equipment:
  2 small swords (IMPACT = 2d6+2)
  a 2 meters wooden pole
  Quilt armor (RESISTANCE = 3)
  
6.3.1 Declaration
-----------------

At the beginning of every combat round, the game master must ask every player
to declare the actions of his character for the round.  The game master must
also state the actions of all NPCs and monsters during that phase.  Once 
stated, these actions cannot be changed, unless the game master feels that
there has been a misunderstanding; in that case, every player should be 
allowed to redeclare the actions of his character.

The declaration order does not really matter as long as the actions of all 
protagonists are stated.  A fixed order, such as *going around the table will
generally speed game play.

Note that a character can attack multiple targets only if he is in close range
(0 to 1 meters) of both targets at declaration time.

Game situation: Jalik and Neila reach the bottom of the stairs about 5 meters 
  below the ground level.
  Game master: In the torchlight, you can see that the floor is littered with
    bones.
  Roger: "[Whisper] Cover me." I slowly crouch to inspect the bones.
  Game master: They look like humanoid bones, generally human sized.
  Roger: I inspect the walls, looking for holes or any trace of a mechanism.
  Game master: You spend 5 minutes doing as careful an inspection you can
    without stepping on the floor.  The walls are plain and smooth.  You can
    detect any obvious crevasse.
  Roger: I slowly pass the wooden pole along the floor and the walls.
  Game master: (rolling a few dice to make good impression) Nothing happens.
  Bob: "[Whisper] It looks ok?"
  Roger: "[Whisper] Yes...  I go first, you follow me 4 steps behind."
    I advance in the passage, tell me when I notice anything different.
  Game master: After 4 meters, the floor is clear of bones.  The transition
    is gradual.
  Roger: I continue.
  Bob: I still follow about 2 meters behind.
  Game master: You walk two more steps and hear a concert of clicking sounds
    as the bone quickly move along the floor to reassemble into three distinct
    shapes.  Two of the shapes are near Neila, while the third is behind 
    Jalik's back.  What do you do?
  Bob: "[Loud] Watch your back!".  Neila attacks the nearest shape and will 
    dodge the two others if necessary.
  Roger: Jalik drops his pole and takes out his two swords.  He will also
    attack the nearest shape.
  Game master: Jalik's attack won't happen until next round, but they won't
    be able to attack this round either.  Neila, you realize that you can 
    bash at the nearest one without worrying about dodging the other.

---- 6.3.1.1 Initiative (OPTIONAL) ----

Some role players find that basing the declaration order on the Talents of
their characters allow for more strategy during combat.  A declaration method
which allow the characters with the best perception to react to the actions
of others is presented here.  

Determining initiative:
1) Roll 1d10
2) Add PER (you may get negative results)

INITIATIVE = 1d10 + PER

All players should roll for initiative and the game master should also roll
it for NPCs and monsters.  In large combats, the game master may wish to roll
initiative for groups of monsters or even for all monsters at the same time.

Actions are then declared starting with the lowest initiative roll to the
highest.  This gives a chance to characters with the highest PER to adjust
their actions to those of others.

[Should we add weapon speed and spell casting time here? It seems weird to 
me to add such a modifier before the action has been declared if the goal
of the initiative roll is of determining who will declare first so that
one can adjust himself to the actions of others.  (Guillaume)]

6.3.2 Action resolution
-----------------------

Once all actions have been declared, they are resolved using standard skill
checks.  The order of the resolution does not matter since all actions within
a round are considered to be simultaneous.  Again, resolving the actions
in a fixed order will speed up the game and simplify combat.

While there are no strict limits to the actions that can be attempted during 
combat, we will focus here on the actions that are directly related to the 
resolution of combat.

---- 6.3.2.1 Targeting ----

The determination of an attack outcome is achieved using the targeting
equation:

2d10* + Att Sk [+ Sk mods] >= 2d10* [+ TD mods] + Def Sk [+ Sk mods]

If the left hand side is greater than or equal to the right hand side, then 
the attacker scores a hit and should proceed to determine damage.

While this expression may seem complex, it summarizes a very simple process:

1) Both the attacker and the defender roll 2d10*, as in a skill check.
2) The attacker adds his Attack Skill to his roll, while the defender
   adds his Defense Skill to his roll.
3) They also add any situation combat modifiers that the game master judge
   necessary to their respective rolls.
4) If the attacker's total is greater than or equal to the defender's total,
   then the attacker is successful in his attack and should now roll for 
   DAMAGE.

The targeting roll can be modified by situation combat modifiers.  These
situation combat modifiers are chosen by the game master and are broken into 
two categories:

   - Task Difficulty Modifiers (TD mods): modifiers that affect the 
     difficulty of the combat task.

   - Skill Modifiers (Sk mods): modifiers that affect the skill of the
     combatants.
     
Situation combat modifiers are detailed in sections 6.3.2.1.1 and 6.3.2.1.2.

OPTIONAL:
   For NPCs, the GM may replace the defender roll by a constant value of 10 
   to accelerate combat resolution:
   
   2d10* + Att Sk [+ Sk mods] >= 10 [+ TD mods] + Def Sk [+ Sk mods]   
          
   Note that this makes the NPCs harder to hit if the PC's attack skill 
   is less than 2 points higher than the defending NPC's skill.  If the PC's 
   skill is 2 points higher or more, then it is easier for the PC to hit.

Game situation:
  (first round) Neila swings her war hammer at the nearest skeleton.
  -> Bob rolls 13 and adds Neila's attack skill of 8 for a total of 21.
  -> The game master rolls 8, adds the skeleton guardian defense skill of
     8 and a skill modifier of -2 due to the fact that the guardian is still 
     taking shape, for a total of 14.
  Neila hits the skeleton and sends crushed bones flying.  In the meantime,
  Jalik wields his two swords.

  (sixth round) Neila is still engaged with two Guardians; she has suffered
  a few hits but has nearly destroyed the first while dodging the other.
  Jalik has also hit is Guardian a few times, while taking only two hits.
  Neila's attack:
  -> Bob rolls 33 (!), adds Neila's attack skill of 8 and substracts 5
     because of the multiple actions (attacking and dodging) for a total
     of 36.
  -> Game master rolls 3 (!) and adds the skeleton defense skill (8) for
     a total of 11.
  ---> Neila scores another precise hit on the first skeleton.
  1st skeleton's attack:
  -> Game master's roll: 1 + 8 = 9
  -> Bob's roll: 8 + 14 - 5 = 17
  ---> Neila blocks the skeleton attempts.
  2nd skeleton's attack:
  -> Game master's roll: 13 + 8 = 21
  -> Bob's roll: 9 + 13 (dodge skill) - 5 = 18
  ---> The skeleton hits Neila.
  Jalik's attack:
  -> Roger's roll: 16 + 11 = 27
  -> Game master's roll: 9 + 8 = 17
  --> Jalik successfully stabs at the skeleton.
  3rd skeleton's attack:
  -> Game master's roll: 17 + 8 = 21
  -> Roger's roll: 17 + 8  = 21
  ---> The skeleton hits Jalik.

---- 6.3.2.2 Damage and Injury ----

When a successful hit has been scored, DAMAGE is computed by substracting
the defender's RESISTANCE from the attacker's IMPACT.

DAMAGE = IMPACT - RESISTANCE

The attacker's IMPACT is the sum of his Strength and his weapon's Impact:

IMPACT = Weapon IMPACT + STR

The RESISTANCE of the defender is the sum of his Natural Resistance and
his armor's Resistance:

RESISTANCE: Natural Resistance + Armor Resistance

Armor Resistance is always a positive value that depends on the type of
armor being worn.   Natural Resistance is a value representing the natural
body covering of a species (see the species description).   Natural Resistance
can be negative.   Because of this, RESISTANCE can be negative as well.

If DAMAGE is lower than 0, then it is considered to be 0.  A DAMAGE of 0 or
less is considered to be just a scratch.  If DAMAGE is greater than 0, then
it should be added to the INJURY heap.

INJURY = INJURY + DAMAGE

Game situation:
  (first round)
  To determine the IMPACT done by Neila's hit on the skeleton, Bob rolls
  11 on 2d6+4 (the war hammer Impact) and adds Neila's STR for a total of
  14.  The game master substract the Natural Resistance (5) of the Guardian 
  from Neila's IMPACT and adds 9 to the Guardian's INJURY heap (previously
  at 0).

  (sixth round) (Note that DAMAGE calculations are normally done just
  after determining if an attack was successful.  All DAMAGE calculations
  are presented here in the same section for explanation purposes)
  -> Neila hits the first skeleton for 11+3=14 points of IMPACT.  This
     increases the skeleton's INJURY by 9 to a total of 36.
  -> The second skeleton hits Neila for 8+2=10 for a DAMAGE of 4 after
     the attack has passed through the armor (RESISTANCE=6).  This
     brings her INJURY heap to 26.
  -> Jalik hits the third skeleton for 6 points of IMPACT.  Only 1 point
     passes the skeleton's Natural Resistance, bringing its injury
     heap to 24.
  -> The third skeleton does 13 points of IMPACT to Jalik.  His armor only
     absorbs 3 points, adding 10 points of DAMAGE to INJURY, for a total
     of 18.

6.3.3 Survival checks
---------------------

At the end of the combat round, after all actions have been resolved, every 
combatant that has been injured during the round (i.e.  that has seen his 
INJURY heap increase) must make Unconciousness and Death checks.

An Unconsciousness check is made by rolling 2d10* and adding the character's
Willpower.  If the total is greater than or equal to INJURY minus BODY,
then the check is successful and the character stays conscious.

Unconsciousness: 2d10* + WIL >= INJURY - BODY

It is not necessary to make an Inconsciousness check until INJURY is greater 
than BODY.

A Death check is similarly made by rolling 2d10* and adding the character's
Fitness.  If the total is greater than or equal to the INJURY minus twice
the BODY value, then the check is successful and the character stays alive.

Death:           2d10* + FIT >= INJURY - 2*BODY

It is not necessary to make a Death check until INJURY is greater than twice 
the BODY value.

OPTIONAL: If the Unconsciousness check is failed by no more than 5 points,
  then the character is not Unconscious but suffers from such pain that he
  is not able to do anything beside moaning and screaming.  He remains
  generally aware of what is happening around him.  As usual, the game master
  is free to apply or ignore this optional rule.

Game situation:
  (first round) The INJURY heap of the first Skeleton Guardian is now equal 
  to 9.  Since this is much lower than twice the BODY value of the skeleton,
  there is no need for a Death check (the skeleton does not check for
  Unconsciousness, see description).

  (sixth round)
  -> Bob's roll for Neila: 9 + 2 (WIL) = 26 (INJURY) - 15 (BODY)
     Neila remains conscious enough to continue the fight.  
  -> Roger's roll for Jalik: 8 + 0 (WIL) > 18 (INJURY) - 15 (BODY)
     Jalik remains conscious.
  -> Game master's roll for the 1st skeleton:
     4 + 0 (WIL) < 36 (INJURY) - 30 (2*BODY)
     The skeleton crumbles into a heap of broken bones.
  -> The INJURY of the third skeleton (24) is lower than twice his BODY (30),
     so there is no need for a death check.

6.4 Movement and Distances in Combat
------------------------------------

6.4.1 Combat Movement
---------------------

While it may be possible for some characters to cover 60 meters in a standard 
6 seconds round, this is not a typical character nor a character loaded with
equipment.   Even if he was, he would be in no condition at the end of the
round
to carry out other actions.  Moreover this speed allows for only the gentlest 
of turns; Combat movement involves turns and other actions.
 
Movement will occur as fast as a characters Agility will allow reduced by his
Encumbrance.

Maximum Movement = 50 + 2*AGI meters per 6 second round
 
Maneuvering or Fighting COMBAT Movement = 3 + AGI/5 (round normally) meters

Maneuvering is limited to = 6 + AGI/2 meters

OPTIONAL: Effects of Fatigue 
 
  Maximum Movement = 50 + 2*AGI - Fatigue  (meters / round)
 
  Combat MOVEMENT = 3 + AGI/5 - Fatigue/10  (meters / round)

6.4.2 Attack reach (OPTIONAL)
------------------

6.4.3 Combat Hex Grid (OPTIONAL)
---------------------

------------------
6.6 Unarmed Combat
------------------

6.6.1 Unarmed Attacks
---------------------

There are five types of unarmed attacks.   For game mechanics, they are
handled the same way as weapons are handled in armed combat styles.
They have an associated damage, reach, etc, just as weapons do.
An unarmed defender against a weapon gets no defence or a penalty, depending
on the fighting style being used.

+-----------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+
+ NAME            | ACTION | IMPACT | REACH | MASS  | LENGTH | HANDS | SPEED |

+-----------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+

6.6.2 Unarmed weapon types
--------------------------

Attacks with hands or fists do 2d6-8 IMPACT, 2d6-6 if using brass knuckles.

Kicking attacks to 2d6-6 IMPACT.   

Bashing attacks include body slams and tackles.   
IMPACT is 2d6-4.   A running start is required to do damage, 
so no IMPACT is done if you are already at close range.   
(possible to force backwards even if starting at close range)

Throws include leg sweeps and judo/wrestling throws.   IMPACT is 2d6-6 and
is not modified by STR.   Success leaves the defender prone.

Hold attacks include judo holds and wrestling pins.   
After a successful attack the defender must make a roll if he wants to
try to break the hold.   
      2d10* + STR + skill >= 10 + holder's STR + skill
The "skill" may be from any style which includes "hold" attacks.
If the hold is successful, the attacker may choose to inflict damage: 
IMPACT is 2d6-4 (+STR).

* Note about HANDS: There are holds and throws which require two hands,
and some which require no hands.   The GM may judge if a maneuver is possible
or more difficult (skill penalty) in some situations, such as if the
player has his hands bound.

-------------
7.2 Overview
-------------

Like every other aspect of DragonNet, the magic system is essentially made up
of skills and tasks which use those skills.  In the specific case of the magic
system, the skills are those which give a character the capability to cast a
magical spell, and the tasks are: first, the use of source skills to access
the
power for the spell, and second, the use of conductor skills to actually
cast the spell.  For example, to cast the "Reading Light" spell involves two 
tasks, the first of which requires the application of the "Power of Daylight" 
skill and the second of which requires the application of the "Light Focus" 
skill.

+Magic often varies from gameworld to gameworld, but the mechanics of how
+magic works are still the same.  In here we will use examples of how magic
+works of the type of magic found in Corellus.  The guidelines presented for
+created types of magic and spells are just that guidelines.

-----------------
7.3 Magic Skills
-----------------

There are two categories of magic skills in the DragonNet system.  These are
source skills and conductor skills.  For a character to successfully cast a
spell, he or she must successfully use source skills to make magical power
available, and then conductor skills to use that power.  For example, a magus'
"Reading Light" spell requires the caster to use the "Power of Daylight"
source
skill and then the "Light Focus" conductor skill.  A more complex spell may
require more than one skill from one or both of those categories, making one
or
both tasks composite in nature.  For example, a magus' "Foobar's Fabulous
Fireball" spell requires the caster to use the "Power of Energy" and "Power of
Entropy" source skills for the task of accessing the power for the spell, and
the "Fire Focus," "Air Focus," and "Water Focus" conductor skills for the task
of using that power.  Thus, the character must succeed on two task
resolutions:
the first to gather the necessary magical energy (source), and the second to 
use the energy made available (conductor).

7.3.1 Sources
--------------

Source skills represent the ability of the caster to draw upon a particular
source of supernatural energy and make that energy available for the casting
of
a spell.  Sources are much like outlets in the modern world.  Outlets are
useless
by themselves, but when their energy is used by an appliance, technological
wonders occur.  So, too, are source skills useless by themselves, but when
their
energy is used by a conductor skill, magic happens.

Whenever a caster wishes to cast a spell, he must make the energy for that
spell available by using one or more source skills.  Making the energy
available
is a simple matter of making a composite task check using the source skill(s)
+ required of the spell at a Task Difficulty (TD) plus the Power Level of the
spell.  For example, the "Reading Light" spell from above is a Power Level 5
+ spell, which uses only the "Power of Daylight" source.  There are no
modifiers
+ for accessing the source, and the base cost is 2.  Therefore, to use that
spell the caster must make the composite task check:

+    2d10* + ["Power of Daylight" Skill] >= 5 + 2

Another spell, Foobar's Fabulous Fireball, is a Power Level 20 spell which
uses
+ both the "Power of Energy" source and the "Power of Entropy" source.  Both of
+ which have a base cost of 2.  To cast that spell, the caster must make the
composite task check:

+ 2d10* + ["Power of Energy" Skill] + ["Power of Entropy" Skill] >= 20 + 2 + 2

+ Power level roughly indicates the level of effect.

If the composite task check fails, the caster is unable to gather the energy
required for the spell and the spell fizzles.  If the composite task check
succeeds, the character has successfully gathered the energy, and may proceed
to harness that energy using the appropriate conductor skill(s).

7.3.2 Conductors
-----------------

Where source skills represent an ability to draw upon a particular source of
supernatural energy, conductor skills represent an ability to use that energy
in a particular way.  Where a source skill is an outlet in the modern world, a
conductor is an appliance.  Without electricity, appliances are useless by 
themselves, but when they are given energy to work with they can do amazing
things.  So, too, are conductor skill useless without energy from a source
skill, but when they have that energy, magic happens.

We must also take the analogy one step further.  Not all appliances can plug
into all outlets throughout the world; they must have compatible voltages and
have the same type of current.  Conductors, too, can only be used with those
sources with which they are compatible.  Energy from any other incompatible
source is useless to them.  The sources with which a given conductor is
compatible are listed in the description for that skill.

Once a caster has gathered the energy from a source or sources, he or she can
utilize that energy by using one or more conductor skills.  Similar to using
source skills, harnessing energy using conductor skills is a simple matter of
making a composite task check using the conductor skill(s) required of the
spell at a Task Difficulty (TD) equal to the Power Level of the spell.  For
example, the "Reading Light" spell from above is a Power Level 5 spell which
only uses the "Focus of Light" conductor.  Therefore, to finish casting this
spell (once energy has been made available from the appropriate source), the
caster must make this task check:

     2d10* + ["Light Focus" Skill] >= 5

As another example, "Foobar's Fabulous Fireball" is a Power Level 20 spell
which requires the Fire, Air, and Water conductors.  Therefore, to finish
casting the spell (once the energy has been gathered, above), the caster must
make the task check:

     2d10* + ["Fire" Skill] + ["Air" Skill] + ["Water" Skill] >= 20

If the composite task check fails, the caster was unable to successfully
conduct the spell's energy and an unpredictable result may occur; the power
was not properly "focused." Once the conductor task check has succeeded,
the spell is cast.
+ Optionally, a failure of the source check can cause damage to the caster.

+ The TD can generally be determined by the complexity of the spell.  Some
+ common modifiers are:
+ Efficiency:
+    1 <-> 9%  = -9 <-> -1
+    10%       =  0
+  20% <-> 90% = 3 <-> 21
+  91% <-> 100%= 24 <-> 51
+
+ Distance:
+ Close   = -3
+ Near    = 0
+ Far     = +5
+ Extreme = +5 per 100m 
+
+ Complexity:
+ # of source     = +5 per source
+ # of conduntors = +2 per conductor
+ 
+ Casting Time:
+ < round = +5
+ round   = 0
+ > round = -1 per minute upto -5 max
+         additional -1 per 10 minutes upto -5
+         additional -1 per hour upto -5
+         additional -1 per day  upto -5
+ -----------------
+ 7.4 Magic Types Guidelines
+ -----------------
+ 
+ Magic can come in many types and flavors.  The GM will probably decide
+ on the types of magic depending on the type of world that is being
+ played in.  The magic types in the standard world 'Corellus' provide
+ good examples of how to set up the types of magic.
+ 
+ The first thing that needs to be decided is what types of magical
+ energy are available for use.  These are the sources that the players
+ can use.  Are there any restrictions on these sources (e.g., priestly
+ sources have the restriction that the priest must be in good favor
+ with that deity).  Sources usually have a base task difficulty associated
+ that reflects how hard it is to draw on that source.
+ 
+ The next decision is, how can these sources be manipulated.  These will
+ be the conductors.  The conductors also usually have a base cost associated
+ with them.  Other modifiers can be used from the table above.
+ 
+ A template for magic types can be found in section 8.5.

-----------------
7.5 Magic Spells
-----------------

The casting of magic spells is the primary task to which source and conductor
skills are put.  The variety in types of spells is as infinite as a player's
imagination.  Spell effects may be small or large, blatant or subtle.  Types
of
spells range from powers of the mind to pyrotechnics of the skies.  Yet
even with all of these differences, there are some basic rules and guidelines
governing the creation and use of spells in the DragonNet system.

7.5.1 Casting Spells
---------------------

Casting a spell operates just like any other task in the DragonNet system with
two minor exceptions:

  1.)  Successful spellcasting requires two consecutive, successful, composite
       task checks: the first to make the energy available to the caster,
       using source skill(s), and the second to harness that available energy
       using conductor skill(s).
  
  2.)  Secondly, spellcasting is much more tiring work than most activities.  
       To reflect this, the caster's fatigue heap is incremented by the Power
       Level of any spell the caster even attempts to cast (regardless of
       success).
       [Ed.  Note: Subject to finalization of the heap rules]

Other differences may occur beyond those mentioned above, depending on the
spellcaster(s), the spell(s), and the skill(s) involved.  For example, some
conductor skills require spells to be researched or otherwise learned before
they can be used.

A verbose example of casting a complex spell:
     Foobar's Fabulous Fireball is a Power Level 20 spell requiring the "Power
     of Energy" and the "Power of Entropy" sources, and requiring the "Fire
     Focus," "Air Focus," and "Water Focus" conductors.  Therefore, the caster
     must make the following two task checks:
       
+ 1.)  2d10* + ["Power of Energy" Skill] + ["Power of Entropy" Skill] >= 20 +
4
          (for the source skills)      
+         (4 is the task difficulty 2 + 2 for the base cost of the sources)
       
+ 2.)  2d10* + ["Fire Focus" Skill] + ["Air Focus" Skill] + ["Water Focus"
            Skill] >= 20 + 22
          (for the conductor skills)
+         ( +10 for the 2 sources, +6 for the 3 conductors, +6 for the base
+           cost of the conductors)

+    If the first check fails, the spell merely fizzles.  Optionally, the 
+    spellcaster may take some kind of damage.  If the second check
     fails, the spell goes wild with effects determined by the GM.  If both
     checks are successful, the spell is cast.

     Finally, regardless of whether the spell succeeded or failed, the
caster's
     fatigue heap must be incremented by one fifth of the Power Level of the 
     spell, which in this case was 20.  Should this result in a fatigue heap 
     greater than its potential (WIL), a fatigue potential check must be made 
     as:
          2d10* + WIL >= Fatigue
     Failure of this check results in unconsciousness.  (See combat rules for
     details).

7.5.2 Spell Attributes
-----------------------

All spells have many of the same basic attributes.  These attributes bear no
relation to a character's attributes, except in that they serve to define the
basic nature of the spell in the same way that character attributes serve to
define the basic nature of a character.  The basic attributes and their values
are:

Power Level
     Each spell must define how much magical energy the spell uses.  This
value
     is the spell's Power Level, and affects how difficult the spell is to
cast
     and how draining the spell is to cast.

Source(s)
     Each spell must also define which source(s) of energy are used to draw
the
     power required by the spell.

+ Source TD
+    The total TD associated with accessing the source(s).

Conductor(s)
     Each spell must also define which conductor(s) must be used to harness
the
     energy once it is gathered from the source(s).

+ Conductor TD
+    The total TD associated with making use of the conductors.

Casting Time
     This value represents the amount of time it takes to successfully cast
     the spell.  This value is usually the Power Level of the spell, in
seconds.

Duration
     This value represents the length of time the spell lasts once it has been
     successfully cast.

Range
     This value represents the maximum distance, in meters, from the caster
     that the spell effect may be centered or initiated.

Volume of Effect
     This value represents the volume of space which is directly affected by
     the casting of this spell.  (Note that secondary effects, like falling
     rocks, may extend beyond this range.)

Spell descriptions may augment or supersede this list of attributes.

7.5.3 Tweaking Spells (VERY OPTIONAL)
--------------------------------------

The ability to tweak a spell allows a spellcaster to modify one or more of the
basic attributes of a spell, or (depending on the spell) some of the specific
effects of the spell (for example, putting more energy into a simple
"Fireball"
spell can increase the damage it does, which is not a basic attribute).  For
those spellcasters restricted to previously learned or researched spells, the
ability to tweak those spells they already know is a godsend.  However, the
degree to which spells may be tweaked is limited, as are the ways in which
they may be tweaked.

When a caster tweaks a spell, he changes an aspect of the spell result by
changing either the Power Level of the spell (for effect changes), or by
changing the TD of the source and/or conductor check  (for casting 
changes).  Which aspects of a spell may be tweaked, and to what degree at
what cost, are generally specific to the spell being cast.  However, there are
two general 'tweaks' which should be available to almost all casters and for
almost all spells:

  1.)  The fatigue caused by a spell may be tweaked by changing the source
        task difficulty.  For every point by which the source task difficulty
is
        increased, the fatigue caused by the spell is decreased by a point to
a
        minimum of 1 point of fatigue.  Similarly, for every point by which
the
        source task difficulty is decreased (to a minimum TD of 1), the
fatigue
        caused by the spell is increased by a point.
  
  2.)  The casting time of a spell may be tweaked by changing the conductor
        task difficulty.  For every point by which the conductor task
difficulty
        is increased, the casting time of the spell is reduced by 1 unit
(where
        the unit is the units in which the spell's casting time is measured,
        be it seconds, minutes, hours, or days).  Similarly, for every point
by 
        which the conductor task difficulty is decreased (to a minimum TD of 
        1), the casting time of the spell is increased by 1 unit.

Almost all other 'tweaks' change the Power Level (and subsequently both the
source and conductor TDs and the fatigue incurred) of the spell.  Examples of
aspects of a spell which might be capable of being tweaked in this way
include:

   * Duration
   * Range
   * Volume of Effect
   * Damage

In general, these aspects may never be tweaked beyond double their original
value, nor tweaked lower than half their original value, and the cost for 
doubling a value should be roughly equal to the original power cost.  

While tweaking as a whole is optional, it is recommended that those campaigns
with high-level spellcasters use, at the least, the rules for decreasing 
fatigue costs and casting times to enable those magi to operate effectively.

7.5.4 Making Spells
--------------------

The procedure and rules used for making a new spell are entirely dependent
upon the types of conductor skills to be used by the Spell.  Some conductors
require research and memorization, some require learning, others allow for
'on-the-fly' creation.  Please see the conductor skill lists for specific
rules.

Using experience dice
---------------------
Once the experience dice have been awarded by the Game Master, the player
has three options:

1.)  He can roll the dice and get a number of experience points equal to their
      total.
2.)  He can play safe and get a number of experience points equal to 4 times 
      the number of experience dice (1 dice = 4 EP).
3.)  He can divide his experience dice between the two options above, 
      choosing to roll some of them and to cash in the remaining ones.  The 
      player must decide how many dice will be rolled before he starts
rolling.

Of course, the Game Master may rule that some options are not available if he
feels that they are detrimental to the game.

Example
-------
Say a player is awarded 10 experience dice.  The player could:

1.)  Roll all 10 dice, which would generate from 10 to 60 points, with an 
      average of 35.
2.)  Exchange the 10 dice for 40 experience points.
3.)  Roll 3 dice and cash in the remaining 7, which would generate between
      31 and 46, with an average of 38.5.

------------------------------
8.2 Experience Dice During Play (Optional)
------------------------------
During a game session, if a character has some experience dice saved up,
he may use them for purposes other than skill advancement.

In this case, Experience Dice can be used for:

1.  Improving a Task Resolution (2d10*) roll
2.  Increasing an Impact roll

To avoid a penalty, a player must declare the use of experience dice 
BEFORE he makes his roll.  He should tell the GM that he wishes to 
modify his pending dice roll with some experience dice.  After the GM has 
been told how many experience dice are going to be used in this way, the 
player rolls the total of the original dice plus how ever many experience 
dice he told the GM he was going to use.

If a player wishes to modify a die roll AFTER he has rolled the dice, he
must do so at a penalty of three times the cost; therefore, the player pays
three experience dice for each die added to the roll.

==============================
8.3 Affliction
==============================

Affliction is the general term given to any condition which will affect a
character adversly, such as poison and disease.  The mechanics for determining
the results of disease or poisoning are the same.


8.3.1 Mechanics
-----------------

All poisons and deisease have a VIRULENCE rateing.  In basic terms, the
VIRULENCE is a measure of the strength of the poison or disease; the
difficulty a person has in overcoming it's effects.

There are two stages of affliction: Partial Effects and Full Effects.  The
effect on a creature will varry from affliction to affliction.  Some example
afflictions will be given below.

A character will suffer partial effects from the affliction if they fail to
make their Partial Effects roll, and likewise, they will suffer the full
effects if they fail to make their Full Effects roll, as given below:

Partial Effects:  2d10* + WIL + BODY >= VIRULENCE
Full Effects      2d10* + 5 + FIT + BODY >= VIRULENCE

Each affliction will also be given an Onset Time.  It is after the Onset Time
has passed that a character is allowed to make their Partial Effects roll.

Should a character succeed in making their Partial Effects roll, they will
suffer no adverse effects from the affliction.  Should the Partial Effects
roll be failed, and after the Onset Time has passed again, the character is
allowed to make their Full Effects roll.  If the character makes their Full
Effects roll, the affliction will proceed no further and the character will
recover in (VIRULENCE - WILL - FIT) days.

If the Full Effects roll is failed, the character will suffer, in addition to
the partial effects, the full effects of the affliction, and, if they survive,
will recover in (VIRULENCE - FIT) days.


8.3.2 Dosage
------------

Doseage for all afflictions is given as `LD50 doseage'.  The LD50 doseage is
defined as the dosage that will cause death in 50% of the creatures exposed to
that doseage.  The LD50 Doseage is given or must be determined for each poison
or disease.

For the administration of either larger or smaller doseages, the following
table is used to determine VIRULENCE:

Dose       TD
---------------
.125       20
.25        25
.5         30   (Half the LD50 Dose)
1.0        35   (LD50 dose)
2.0        40   (Double the LD50 Dose)
4.0        45
8.0        50

For each doubling in administered dose, +5 is added to the TD.  GM's should
note that, for poisons, an increased doseage administered will increase the
chance of the poison being detected.

All LD50 Doseages are given assuming roughly human body size and weight.


8.3.3 Example Afflictions
-------------------------

Size Factor:  A number showing a creature's size relative to humans.

Strength Factor: A number showing a creature's strength relative to humans.

SR: Size Rateing, to be used in targeting rolls.

STR: Strength.

Height: The average height of a typical creature of that size.

LIFT:   kg unless otherwise indicated
        Attempting to lift LIFT overhead has a TD of 15.
        For every 10% increase in weight above LIFT, increase TD by 2
        For every 10% decrease in weight below LIFT, decrease TD by 2
        Shortcut Formula: TD = 20 * weight / LIFT - 5

LOAD:   kg unless otherwise indicated
        LOAD is the amount of weight a character can carry before they will
        feel the effects of encumberance.

        Upon GM request, a character must make an Encumberance check using:
           2d10* >= TD
        where TD increases by 5 for every 10% of weight above LOAD:
           Encumberance  TD
           ------------  --
           LOAD           0
           LOAD+10%       5
           LOAD+20%      10
           LOAD+30%      15

           LOAD+50%      25
           LOAD+60%      30
           etc.
        Shortcut Formula: TD = 50 * (Encumbrance/LOAD) - 50

Example:
=======================
Title: (Not yet decided upon a title)
Author: Tom
Game World: (?)
Location(s): This is a maritime adventure with possibility of piracy.  The
  technology can be called enlightened medeval.  The naval technology reaches
  out into the 18th century as far as sailing technology is concerned.  There
  is no gun powder, however, so there are no guns or cannons.  The world has
no
  moon, instead it has a second sun which is somewhat brighter than the moon
  illuminating the sky at very dark levels of twilight illumination when the
  yellow sun is absent from the night sky.  The year is 400 days long with
each
  season lasting 100 days.  There are no months since there is no moon.  There
  is also an 80 year climate cycle called the grand season, this is due to
  that second orange sun.  At the time of this adventure the world is in its
  second year of grandsummer about 10 days into local spring.  The origins of
  the use of the metric system in an otherwise medeval setting are lost in the
  mists of time and legend.
Time: 10 days into spring, second year of grandsummer.
Participants: Player Characters, Pirates, seamonsters
Background: 
Plot sketch: A map to a treasure is found, location of treasure is at an
  abandoned castle.
Notes: More details will be forthcoming.
