Hi again,

Although this is the world oriented material the dnworlds stuff is confined to
section 3. Section 3 has a lot of stuff, some of which is not as recent as
others. So, anyone willing to update stuff? Another note, I did not include
all species, just the major ones in Corellus. The other species are not
generally as oriented towards Corellus or were done quite a while ago.

Again I think splitting the material like I have works out pretty well, but
will defer to whatever the group wants.

*************************************************************************
TO DO -> review and integrate world material to be current with the
         templates.
      -> review magic skills and add magic spells.
      -> decide if we want to stick with this format

3.0b3 -> separated out material from 3.0b2 so this only includes world
         specific material.
      -> added all of the current world material in

2.2.1 Combat Styles
-------------------

One of the fundamental premises behind the DNET combat system is that one's
fighting style is more important than the actual weapon used.  A fighter used
to fighting with a broad sword and a shield will find it much easier to fight
with a bastard sword and a shield than to fight with a broad sword alone.  His
combat reflexes are tuned to certain strike sequences relying on the shield
to parry blows.  For him, fighting without the shield means developping new
strike sequences, something that is not always easy to do in the middle of
a melee.

Table Description
-----------------
EP Cost - This is the training cost associated with the skill
Attribute Tal - The attribute which forms the basis for using this skill.
                (i.e. The attribute acts as a modifier for use of the skill
                                in the targeting equation.)
Attribute Adv - This attribute is used as a modifier for advancement of
                the skill.
AM - Attack modifier
DM - Defense modifier

Special Characteristics
-----------------------

Range: Close (0 - 1 m; actually engaged in close combat)
       Near (1 - 10 m; engaged or able to move to engage this round)
       Far (11 - 100 m; not in melee range, but probably in missile weapon
                        range)
       Extreme (> 100 m; out of all but the longest range missile weapons)

2nd rank: extended weapon reach to attack opponents from a distance, as from
  behind a line of friendly shield bearers.

Fend: Basically Fend keeps opponent with shorter weapon at a distance unable
  to attack.  Opponent who loses against Fend either cannot attack or takes
  automatic hit at full damage (maximum for thrusting weapon and STR bonus).

  A Fend can be started if an opponent is outside of Close range at the start
  of a combat round. Otherwise, a successful Fend means that an opponent who
  is at Close range is unable to attack in the next round. A successful Fend 
  must occur in each subsequent round to keep the opponent at bay.

Entangle: entangle limbs.  A successful attack will entangle the limbs of the
  defender, unless an AGI check against a TD equal to the attacker's total roll 
  is made by the defender. The attacker must specify that he is trying to
  entangle during the declaration phase.

Trip: entangle legs and trip opponent.  A successful attack will entangle the
  legs of the defender, unless an AGI check against a TD equal to the 
  attacker's total roll is made by the defender. The attacker must specify 
  that he is trying to trip during the declaration phase.

Shield bonus: +1 to +5 defense bonus depending on the type of shield

Shield bash: ability to use shield as a weapon.  Blow causes 1d6 + 1 point per
  size category of the attacker + STR of attacker.  Defender is knocked off
  his feet unless a successful AGI check against a TD equal to the attacker's 
  total roll is made.

DEF Fencing/Close only: Defense against Fencing and Close styles only.

Gives the character a chance to catch missiles, but only if the playersays he 
will try to do so in the declaration phase. The task difficulties (TD) for the 
various kind of missiles are given below:

Missile                   TD
Spear                    D/10
Axe, dagger, etc         D/15

Disarm

This skill is used in place of a normal attack to attempt to disarm an 
opponent. The success check is:

    2d10* + att's skill + STR >= 2d10* + def's STR + def's skill

This skill can be used by both armed and unarmed combatants. Some combat
styles may have modifiers that are added to your roll when you attempt
to disarm an opponent.

  the nearest kilogram) to their roll.

Dodge

Description:
The Dodge skill allows the character to attempt to escape blows from two
opponents for each Dodge action. It can be used in conjunction with the
Style attack/defenses using the multiple actions mechanism. For example,
if a fighter wants to attack one opponent and Dodge two others, the
Style actions (attack and defense) and the Dodge action (evading the blows
from the two other opponents) will be rolled with a -5 penalty. If the
dodge skill is used in conjunction with a shield, the bearer can add the
shield bonus to his defense roll.

Evade Missiles
--------------
Allows character to dodge incoming missiles. The player must declare that the
character will try to do so during the declaration phase. Task difficulties
are the same as for Catch Missiles.

2.2.3 Unarmed Combat Styles
---------------------------

I would like to use a minimal list of unarmed combat styles, since it is
more in the spirit of the current weapon styles.  A well rounded martial
artist using this list would learn Karate for the hand and foot maneuvers,
Close Weapons for the usual list of Chinese peasant weapons, Judo for
the throws, Staff, and One-Handed Weapon skills.

*All Sources have a NSP of Impossible.

                              Table 2.4.1

Celestial Power of Darkness
     The Celestial Power of Darkness is one of the two Celestial Powers, those
     source skills used by Celestial Magi. This particular source allows a
     magus to call upon 'negative' magical energy to use with the Celestial
     Foci, those conductor skills compatible with the Celestial Powers and used
     by Celestial Magi. Darkness, when used with a Celestial Focus, destroys or
     diminishes that which falls under the purview of that Focus. The Power of
     Darkness is not an evil power, as many seem to believe, it is simply one
     of the destructive powers of the universe.

Celestial Power of Daylight
     The Celestial Power of Daylight is the 'positive' Celestial Power. It is
     used to build up and enhance in ways depending upon which aspect of the
     power the magus chooses to focus into form and reality.

Elemental Power of Energy
     The Power of Energy plays the role for Elemental Magi that the Power of
     Daylight plays for Celestial Magi. This power creates, enhances, and
     builds up the elements.

Elemental Power of Entropy
     The Power of Entropy is the opposite of the Power of Energy. Its role is
     similar to that of the Power of Darkness of the Celestial Magi. It tears
     down, destroys, and subdues the elements under its control. It is the
     unrelenting force in the universe that will not rest until all is
     destroyed. Again, this Power is not evil inherently, only when used for
     evil deeds.

Kundalini
     Kundalini is the raw energy which exists in the Astral Plane. The Psionic
     draws upon Kundalini and uses it through different Chakras (the associated
     conductors) to achieve different effects. The Psionic is more versatile
     than the Magi, but less powerful at manipulating his reality. None surpass
     the Psionic's mastery of the mind, however.

Spirit of [spirit]
     The Spirit world is the domain of the Shamanic spell-caster. For each type
     of Spirit the Shaman wishes to contact and commune with, the Shaman must
     have a Source skill. After the Spirit has been contacted using this Source
     skill, the Shaman must commune with the Spirit using the Communion
     conductor skill to attempt to explain to the Spirit what is desired, and
     to convince the Spirit to do as it is asked.

Doctrine of [deity]
     The power of the gods is available to those who call themselves Priests.
     Priests worship one (or, rarely, more) deity who answers his Priests'
     prayers and requests in the form of Miracles (spells). In order to have
     one's prayers heard by a deity, the Priest must have a skill in that
     deity's Doctrine. This skill represents how well the Priest knows the
     teachings and requirements of the deity necessary to get part of the
     deity's attention. The higher the character's skill in Doctrine, the
     greater portion of the deity's attention is gained. Once the Priest has
     successfully contacted the deity with a Doctrine skill, he must pray the
     the deity does as he wishes, the success of which is determined by the
     Priest's Piety skill to that deity.

*All Conductors have a NSP of Impossible.

                              Table 2.4.2

Elemental Earth Focus
     The earth is the focus of physical power. This aspect of energy affects
     all things with solid physical form. With this power the magus may raise
     up great mountains, or bring them crashing down upon his foes. The earth
     aspect of entropy allows the magus to destroy the physical. With it he can
     disintegrate physical objects and beings, or create doorways where none
     were before.

Elemental Fire Focus
     Fire is the form of true power. Fire is heat, warmth, life, and energy. By
     mastering the aspect of fire, a magus can hurl balls of flame towards his
     enemies, or keep warm on a cold winters night. He can cause forest-fires
     in the dead of winter, or light a dark passage. Using entropy, the magus
     can hurl balls of ice, or stamp out natural or magical flames, or even put
     out the fire within each person.

Elemental Air Focus
     The focus of air is the ethereal aspect of the elemental powers. It
     controls winds and gravity. With the energy of air, a magus can fly above
     his enemies, or blow thunderstorms over their heads. The entropy of air
     can cause suffocation of his enemies, or bring things down to earth.

Elemental Water Focus
     The water focus is the domain of the seas and the lakes. It has complete
     control over liquids in all its forms. It can bring water into being for
     the benefit of the magus, or drown the magus' enemies. It can also create
     patches of ice, or slippery stones. The entropy aspect of this focus
     destroys water, soaks it up. This aspect can turn an enemy into parched
     dry bones instantly, or dry up a lake which happens to be in the way.

The 5th Elemental Focus
     Powerful Elemental Magi have theorized the existence of a 5th Element of
     unknown properties which could be used with the Energy or Entropy sources
     of Elemental magic. Unfortunately, no one has yet discovered this elusive
     Element, or determined its probable nature. Perhaps the sages of DnExotica
     will, in time, solve this perplexing mystery :). Current theories include
     the concept of an Element of Nothingness, or Void, an Element of Pure
     Magic, an Element of Spirit, an Element of the Aether, that which fills
     the Void, or a Quintessential Element. It is believed that once the 5th
     Element is discovered, many of the mysteries of Elemental magic will be
     solved.

Celestial Aurora Focus
     The aurora, which appears in the northern night sky, is the most beautiful
     and entrancing of all celestial elements. Through the study of this
     wondrous effect, magi are able to draw upon and use its ability to charm
     and entrance the observer. With this focus, the magus may charm an enemy
     and calm his friends. With the darkness of the aurora, a magus may strike
     fear into his enemy, remove charmed influences from his friends, and
     prevent beguiling effects from manipulating himself or others.

Celestial Comet Focus
     The comet is the messenger of the heavens. Continually moving at blinding
     speeds throughout the night sky, it is the master of all movement. By
     studying the properties of the comet, the magus is able to use its
     movement for himself. With this focus he can instantly move anywhere in
     the world, or, in combination with the focus of the firmament, he can even
     move out of this world. The darkness of the comet prevents movement,
     imprisoning and trapping enemies, and preventing others from coming near.

Celestial Firmament Focus
     The light of the sky and the heavens above is the study of the firmament.
     Those magi who strive to understand the magnitude of the firmament, are
     able to transcend this reality and get a glimpse into other realities of
     infinite varieties. Through this study, magi can commune with gods or
     angels or demons. In combination with the field of comet, magi are even
     able to walk the infinite planes of existence. Through the study of the
     night sky, the darkness of the heavens, magi are able to block off the
     conduits through which these inter-planar communion occur. With this
     discipline, magi can return foreigners to their home realities, and
     prevent their return, or stop the communication of other magi with
     extra-planar beings.

Celestial Light Focus
     Light is purity incarnate. This focus allows the magus to wield true
     power, without manipulation. With it bolts of pure magical energy can
     spring forth from the casters hand, or magical effects can be detected or
     enhanced. The dark allows the magus to cancel the magic of others or
     inhibit magic.

Celestial Moon Focus
     The moon is the mistress of mysteries, the lady of the night. Under her
     pale glow, reality takes on new dimension. By studying the moon, magi are
     able to use her light to mask reality, to make what isn't really there
     come to life. With this power, magi can weave strange and powerful
     illusions of things which only exist by the light of the moon, though the
     moon does not need to actually be shining for the magus to draw upon her
     power. Those who study the dark side of the moon, on the other hand, can
     see through all pretenses and appearances to the stark reality underneath,
     though the vision is not always a pleasant one. Illusions have no affect
     on those who wield the power of the dark side of the moon, and all that
     was once hidden comes clear.

Celestial Stars Focus
     The stars in their infinite formations hold the knowledge of all that was,
     all that is, and all that will be. Through the study of starlight, the
     magus can glean some small inkling into the vastness of the universe and
     can divine what is and what will come. Through knowledge of the light of
     the stars, all knowledge comes clear. However, by manipulating the dark
     stars, magi are able to obscure the meaning the stars hold. They can
     prevent less powerful magi from discerning particular knowledge, or even
     misdirect such inquiries.

Celestial Sun Focus
     The sun is the giver of life, the celestial orb that brings warmth and
     health to all the realms. Therefore, the sun is the focus of life. The
     celestial magus who masters the sun aspect of daylight masters life
     itself. He is capable of healing, or even of bringing those which were
     dead back to the realms of the living. However, the one who masters the
     darkness aspect of the sun learn the true meaning of death, and with that
     knowledge can bring death to others and undo the work of the sun.

Astral Chakra
     This is the Chakra that allows the Psionic that in addition to the normal
     capabilities of drawing power from the Astral Dimension, allows the
     Psionic to also travel into this dimension and to summon creatures from
     the Astral dimension.

Body Chakra
     Man is not made of only a mind, but also a physical body. Through the use
     of this Chakra, the Psionic can utilize the Astral energy to enhance his
     physical attributes.

Dream Chakra
     This powerful Chakra allows the Psionic to achieve superhuman feats, as he
     accomplishes them not in this world, but the world of his dreams. Of
     course, the unnaturally good is tempered with the unnaturally bad--most
     Dream powers carry some penalty, as they are under control of the Psionic
     subconscious, and not his conscious mind.

Emotion Chakra
     This Chakra deals with the emotional, colorful side of the mind, whereas
     Mind deals with the cold, logical side of the mind.

ESP Chakra
     Clairvoyance, reading the future, picking up auras would be included in
     this Chakra. It would also affect how much the psionic can perceive while
     in the astral plane.

Mind Chakra
     The Psionic's most powerful tool is his mind. Utilizing the Chakras of
     mind allows the Psionic not only to delve deeper into his mind than he
     normally would be capable of doing, but it also allows him to delve into
     the mind of others when it is used in conjunction with other Chakras.

Reality Chakra
     This Chakra is about imposing a Psionic's will over reality. Control over
     Fire, Air, Water, and Earth would be included in this Chakra. A psionic
     wouldn't be able to manipulate these elements as well as an elemental
     magus. An example of this Chakra would be a fire-starter (pyrogenic).

Temporal Chakra
     This Chakra would be allow the psionic to affect the flow of time and to
     perceive in things in the future and/or past. Examples of this would be
     (in conjunction with other Chakras) slowing down metabolism, fortune
     telling, speeding healing, etc.

Piety to [deity]
     The Piety skills represent how devout and reverent a character has learned
     to act towards a particular deity. Because the nature of worship required
     by separate deities is different, there is a unique Piety skill for each
     deity. Pragmatically, the Piety skills are what keep Priests on the 'good'
     sides of their deities. That is to say, the Piety skill helps to convince
     the deity to act in the best interests of the Priest, after the Priest has
     gotten part of the deity's attention, instead of, say, killing the priest
     :)

     Because the Priest must be able to gain a part of the deity's attention
     before making his request, the Priest must first have at least 1 level of
     training in the Doctrine skill of a deity before he may be trained in the
     Piety skill of that deity.

Communion with Spirits
     The Communion conductor is what allows those who weave Shamanic spells to
     commune with the denizens of the Spirit world. It is this communion which
     allows the caster to communicate to the Spirits his or her desires.
     Without this, the Spirits would be powerless to help the caster. The skill
     level a caster possesses in the Communion skill represents how capable the
     caster is of communicating complex wishes to Spirits.

     Before using the Communion skill, the caster must first contact the Spirit
     with which he wishes to commune using the appropriate Spirit skill, and he
     must, therefore, have some skill in a Spirit skill before gaining training
     in the Communion skill.


-------------------------------------
3.1.1 How the Universe Formed
-------------------------------------

How the Corellus universe formed:

In the beginning, there was nothing but Purpose, which had a great purpose
to fulfill by the end of time. But Purpose was without form, so it called
into being Necessity. Necessity, being driven by Purpose, brought into form
the Means by which the purpose could be accomplished. Thus were the gods
born in harmony. 
        
For eons this was the way of things. But over the course of time, it came
to pass that Purpose changed, and the Means could no longer meet the
purpose. And so Necessity altered the Means and created the gods, each of
which had a part to play in the purpose. However, the changing of the
purpose and the process of altering the Means affected Necessity, which gave
birth to two new forces -- Order and Chaos. But Order and Chaos worked
against each other, and thus put the purpose in danger. Once again
Necessity, acting as the agent of Purpose, intervened and forced balance.

However, the Means (the gods) had become tainted by the influence of Order
and Chaos and quarreled among themselves. Thus were introduced the qualities
of jealously, hate, anger, envy, and greed. So too were born love,
compassion, pleasure, hope, and determination. And so, armed with these new
emotions (which the gods had not had before), the gods shattered the harmony
that had infused the purpose. They found themselves at cross-purposes and
began to fight among themselves.

In the course of these battles, which were terrible indeed, some were slain
and their essences scattered. These became known as the Lost Gods. fearful
for both its children and the Purpose it served, Necessity once again
intervened. This time, it created a world, a place for the gods to rest and
live in peace.

The gods were content for a time, but Order and Chaos soon spawned a new
emotion, one which the gods had never before experienced -- loneliness. The
world was beautiful, certainly, but it was sterile and empty. And thus, the
gods created the beasts and the trees.

This was good for a time, but the gods were still not satisfied. And so,
the gods created the intelligent species, each in their own image. Once
again, the gods were content for a time as each presided over the growth of
their people. 

As before, however, it was not enough. And so the gods then made the
greatest of their creations -- the Dragons. Each god made but a very few,
and each Dragon was unique. Finally the gods were satisfied with what they
had made. Necessity, too, was pleased, for these things had been foretold
and were necessary for the purpose.

However, once again Order and Chaos, Necessity's unruly offspring, made
their presence felt. As before, the gods quarreled, but this time their
creations were dragged into the fray as well. This war was terrible and
threatened entire species with extinction. Some of these species were
crucial to the purpose, so Necessity again took action. As the devastation
reached a peak and all was nearly lost, a compromise was worked out where
each god was given great power over certain things in the world. One was
supreme over war, one over the seas, and another magic, and so on.

As each god assumed their position, the intelligent species sought their
help and guidance, for they were, after all, their children. Though each
species maintained a special tie with the god which had created it, new
ties were forged with the other gods. Those interested in magic, regardless
of species, followed the deity of magic; those who sought glory in battle
found strength and courage in the deity of battle; and so on. Old enemies
are difficult to forgive and forget, however, so each species had its own
name for the dieties, and in this way convinced themselves that they were
not consorting with the enemy. 
        
Over time, the lines blurred until only a very few realized that the
deities were the same, but merely had different names. Of course, the fact
that the deities could alter their form and appearance at will also led to a
different appearance in each species. In one species, for instance, the diety
existed as a kindly old man; in another the diety was seen as a happy young
maiden. The deity, being beyond mortal understanding and comprehension, was
indeed both.

Thus were born the gods as we know them today --

----------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.2 Life Essence of Beings
--------------------
On the essence of beings:

The following discussion is intended to motivate the actions and abilities of
beings in the Corellus world. It is not intended to have any direct affects on
the mechanics of the DNet system. It just tries to provide a framework for how
spirits and life energy function and what can happen to them.

Some definitions:

Spirit/Soul - The kernel of a beings consciousness. How this kernel is
reflected in the beings personality ultimately depends on the environment in
which it is functioning. The removal of the spirit/soul removes any independent
action from the being. Spirit/Souls can not be created nor destroyed by any
known force.

Life Energy - The amount of energy a being has to perform their tasks and to
generally function. It is diminished by normal wear and tear of living,
injuries, and mental/psychological trauma. Normal sources of restoring energy
are food and physical and mental aid.

Essence - Basically a spring which replenshishes life energy. Essences are
similar to sources of magic or sources which the deities use, but much smaller.
They are typically attached to the spirit/soul.

Discussion:
In general beings have a pool of energy (Life Energy) and a spring (Essence)
which helps to restore it. Food helps replenish the pool, but generally doesn't
provide enough energy for beings to last. Numbers aren't given here, because
this isn't meant to be used directly in the mechanics, but a being who is
blocked off from their essence will generally die within a short period of time
(relative to their lifespan). Some beings supplement their pool with other
energy in order to survive. (e.g. zombies drain energy from other beings)
Generally beings can not tap into magical sources to supplement their energy as
magical energy is too 'raw'. It is possible that priests could tap into their
deities for energy for a while.

Some beings actually have a negative essence which drains energy from their
pool. Other beings are able to partially block another beings essence.

When death occurs the spirit, life energy, and essence remain together but
travel together to a place of judgement. At this place Amar (or 
someone) separates out the three. The life energy goes to Dem' the
essence goes to Niam and the spirit/soul destination depends upon
their faith. If none then they go to Niam. 

The essences and spirit/soul remain with their caretakers for a period of
time. At a time determined by Necessity a spirit/soul or essence will be
taken and manifested in a new being.


--------------------
3.2 Events
--------------------

These are the events which set the backdrop for where the campaign is to
start. This recent history is divided into epochs that represent major time
periods which shaped what the current setting is.


--------------------
3.2.1 Epoch 0:
--------------------

Sylain (magic) creates the weejon on a new land, that holds no others
of the intelligent species...  She makes a deal with Niam (life) to keep this
place free of the 'evils' of the other species... Demenateez (death) does
not like seeing them plotting together and sees this as something that
could be potentially bad to him in the future...  He calls out to
Morgrius (plague) to send a plague on the populace.

Weejon had a thriving population and an advanced civilization with the
capital city with 150,000 people and about 2 million people over the whole
continent.  Most of the population (90%) is in towns or cities.

The plague strikes and wipes out 90 % of the population (really nasty plague)
city life and corruption are blamed and deeply planted as bad things.
following disruption and war reduces population to 25,000.

Population stabilizes at about 15,000 civilization is now tribal in nature
people are mostly hunter/gathers with a written and oral language

Tribes usually max out at about 50-75 with any more being viewed as
bordering on 'evil'

Amar (judgement)
is petitioned by both Sylain and Niam that Morgrius has upset the balance
by releasing a plague and killing so many weejon...  Demenateez then
interferes by accusing Sylain and Niam of doing it first by declaring that
any place be specific to just one form of life, and that Morgrius was
in fact balancing the acts that they had commited. Deliberations and all
last several hundred years.

Amar, forced to see the logic in this, declares that no land may be
specific to just one species of life, and for good or bad they all have
a right to be in any place...

As such, Amar begins selecting a few other species to send to the
weejon's land...  Of these the humans are selected to go first...  So a ship
that holds some humans (probably unknown to them why) is thrown to
the hardships of the sea and they find themselves washed ashore on the
weejon's island...

--------------------
3.2.2 Epoch 1:
--------------------

During epoch 1, the human population begins to increase rapidly.  The growth
forces the humans to expand faster into weejon territory.  This results
in some conflicts with individual tribes now and then, in which the human
win. During this time the human settlement becomes a small trade center
for finished goods. Since the Weejons are mostly tribal the only finished
goods that they have are relics from before the plague. Some of the
tribes see a good opportunity to trade raw materials for finished goods.

Some of the weejon, who already view human culture as "evil" civilization, are
rather alarmed by its expansion.  Eventually an ambitious weejon leader
rises up using the threat of "evil" human culture as a rallying point,
along with the excuse of some unwarrented attacks by humans on weejons, which
were further exagerated by the survivors.  This leader manages to unite
quite a few tribes to try and eradicate the human threat.

Only about 1/3 of the 15,000 Weejon are close enough to be involved
so the numbers work out to be something like....
The numbers work out to be something like
against    neutral   for      humans
30%          60%     10%       100%
1500        3000     500       500

Several outlying human farms are razed, and the weejons advance on
the central city.  Meanwhile, the humans rally to defend the city.
A major battle ensues, with heavy losses on both sides.  The city's
fortifications (epoch 1 version) are breached, but the leader becomes
too bold, and gets trapped and killed inside the walls.  The weejon
retreat back outside, and the two sides finally agree to cease hostilities
and make a peace agreement.  The agreement is not at all strong, since
by the end of the battle, both sides are glad to call it quits, and
each side goes home declaring itself nonimally the winner.

The 'war' doesn't last long but signifies a change in how the two
species relate to each other.

Afterwards, the humans vow to be better prepared for any future invasion,
and rebuild the city fortifications in a greatly strengthened (epoch 2)
style.  The weejon, without their ambitious leader, return to their
individual tribes, where they are satisfied with the peace, since the
humans, recovering from their losses, no longer need to expand into the
weejon lands and forest.

The humans also give the weejon more respect now, and some tribes even
increase their trade with the humans, with mutually prosperous outcomes,
helping to reduce the stigma of human civilization.  Other tribes however,
continue to hold grudges against the humans, and someday the human
population will increase and start to expand again...

--------------------
3.2.3 Epoch 2:
--------------------

Epoch 2 was generally a time of peace and prosperity
for the Humans and Weejon until the Elven invasion. 

The Humans did not grow out so much as they did up
in the sense that their town grew larger and they
relied more on trade with the Weejon to provide
raw materials. Ship building was just beginning
to occur on the scale of riverboats, mostly to
support increased trade. Some expedition ocean
ships were built, sent and never heard from again.
After a rash of fires and other mishaps from magic,
magic use was limited in the town to those having
a magic license. Their were stiff penalties for
those who violated the law.

The Weejon returned somewhat back to normal. A greater
understanding and friendship with the Humans grew.
And some tribes actually settled down and took up 
agriculture and formed small villages.

Towards the end of the second Epoch an influx of
Goblin refugees started appearing. The refugees 
were fairly aggressive in taking what they want.
The Weejon were most affected, and started hunting
these strangers to keep them away. Some elite
human troops were also involved in searching for
the goblins.

As time went on the Goblins settled more to the
NE part of Corellus.

More troubling were the Weejon refugees from the
NW, were they carried tales of a huge elven/goblin
invasion force (2500). These refugees generally
became adopted by various tribes and were in part
a catalyst for the formation of two Weejon nations,
the larger in the SW portion and the smaller in
the center and eastern part. The other reason
for the formation of the Weejon nations were the
elves who were pushing into the inland. As they
progressed inward from the NW, the Weejon and
then the Humans started slowing them down.
After about 30 years the Elves had about a third
of the continent and were not making any more progress.
Political forces in the Elven homeland were the
major reason for the stop. In another 50 years
the Elves had lost their hold on the central area
of their empire and the Elven governor held mainly
the NW coastal areas. The central area had
become a set of small kingdoms of elves, goblins,
and weejon (in that order). The Central-Eastern
Weejon nation now was just the Eastern nation.

--------------------
3.2.4 Epoch 3
--------------------

Epoch 3 is a relatively quiet epoch (relative to the previous ones).
After the Elven advance had been stopped and driven back to an extent
numerous small kingdoms sprang up in the central part of Corellus.
The major kingdoms (elven - nw, human -s & se, weejon w & e, goblins -ne)
all consolidated their power and sought to achieve some stability.
As stability returned trade began to prosper and towards the end
of the epoch a renaissance had begun, with an expanding middle class.

Notes on species follows:

Human:
The human population during this time grew rapidly. The human kingdom
expanded to the North, gobbling up several of the smaller kingdoms that
had sprung up where the elves had gone. The church grew in power during
this epoch and began to directly affect the government. Sentiment in
the church lately has been pushing to regulate the growing amount of
magic use by all species.

Weejon:
The weejons grow even more urban during this time. Although there are
some who fear large gathering or believe it is wrong, the population
as a whole is becoming more comfortable. Two large towns have been 
established in the west and a medium size one has been created in
the east.

Elves:
Little is known about what has been happening with the elves. A truce
has been worked out with the elven govenor. There have been rumors
that the elven kingdom has left the elven empire, but as there is little 
communication with the elves this is considered mostly a rumor.

Goblins:
A confederacy of sorts has arisen out of the major houses. There is still
much internal strife among the goblins. There is no war between them
and the weejon, but there are still occasional skirmishes between them.
They have had little direct contact with the humans, and are still
very much opposed to the elves. Officially they consider themselves
at war with the Elves, though not much fighting or advances on either
side have occurred.

Description:

(this still needs some work)

Men are only allowed to own as many possesions as they can carry. Thus women,
control all of the real wealth in the society. Men are responsible for heading
the various professional societies (craftsman, laborers, sailors, soldiers,
etc) although there are no explicit restrictions on who may participate. Women
may gain positions of limited leadership in their field, and there is no
favoritism officially between the sexes, but traditionally only men have filled
the top spot.

Does this sound roughly fair? i would like distinct but equivalent
possibilities for each. We can exchange their roles also.

As far as government.
How about a coucil of sorts. The 4 oldest of each gender forms the council,
which sees to the everyday running of the town. The council interacts with
the leaders of the professions and the affluent women. They are resonsible for
taxing and removing profession leaders, which requires 8 votes. Professions
elect their own leaders though.  Also part of the council are the leader and 3
clergy. The leader is the highest ranking member of the council and is
elected by the people for 5 years, the clergy are all equal and second in
ranking, they represent deities A, C and Nogris. The leader has an assistant
who (s)he chooses, while not part of the council, is the leaders successor
should anything happen to them.  After a leader is finished their terms
they serve as an advisor to the council for typically a year.


Epoch 3
The human population during this time grew rapidly. The human kingdom
expanded to the North, gobbling up several of the smaller kingdoms that
had sprung up where the elves had gone. The church grew in power during
this epoch and began to directly affect the government. Sentiment in
the church lately has been pushing to regulate the growing amount of
magic use by all species.

General Description:
Weejons have long straight brown hair which is just a shade lighter than
their skin tone.  Most Weejons do not cut their hair.  Like their cousins
the elves, their eyes are almond shaped and their ears are pointed.  One
difference, is that a Weejon's eyes change color based on their mood.
 
     Red    - Angry, Threatened
     Blue   - Sad, Mournful
     Yellow - Scared, Worrisome
     Green  - Mischevious
     Brown  - Normal
 
There is a common phrase "More angry than a red-eyed Weejon".  When a
Weejon passes away, its eyes turn white except for the pupils.  They are
lithe and graceful like their elven cousins.
 
Due to their small stature, they are not incredibly strong beings.
They are, however, very agile.  They can move incredibly fast through
any terrain and are excellent climbers.
 
In general, the Weejons are a very joyous race.  They enjoy dancing and
singing and have large festivals with each change of season.  They are
also encouragable pranksters.  They love to play jokes on unwary 
travellers passing by or camping in the vicinity of their woodlands.
 
The Weejons can be compared to the wolverine: small but fierce.
Weejons are very brave and fight with a ferocity belied by there size.  
Since they are so small, the weapons the use are also small.  Generally, 
they choose bows, blowguns, small spears, and mini-crossbows.  When in 
close combat, they will weild two daggers, with one half again the size 
of the other.  If they use a short sword it is treated as a two-handed 
weapon.
 
For protection, they have two innate abilities.  The first is the ability
to blend in with nature rendering them virtually invisible to non-Weejons.  
This only works within natural areas full of plants, bushes and 
trees.  They do not blend in with rocks!  The second is the night vision.
 
After mating, the mother and father pass a portion of their life force on
to the child.  Each Weejon can mate three times before passing to the
realm beyond.

They are born in the forest and are raised until the age of five.  It is
at this age that they are bonded with an animal.  The parents (GM) decide
what type of animal and place the child with the young of that species.
Usually the bonded animal is the offspring of a previously bonded animal.
Once grown, the animal and the Weejon can communicate their thoughts
telepathically.

Tribal Culture
--------------
Skill Packages:
   warrior-1      athletic, combat, nature

Common skills:
   climbing
   dancing
   running
   singing

Description:
The Weejons are 'enlightened' in that they treat both men and women the same.
Everyone does a little of everything that needs to be done.  They are mostly
hunters and gathers, although they do herd some animals.  Being hunters/gathers
they tend to move around alot.  They do have 'territories' for the tribe
which are based mainly on geographic boundaries. The boundaries are not srictly
enforced either.  Weejon, in general, do not believe in personal property.
Everything belongs to the tribe, although some objects are kept by certain
people and are passed down to the children.  The only specialized position is
that of shaman.  The shaman(s) has two special purpose magical devices.
One is to determine who the next shaman will be, the other to determine who is
on the tribal counsel.  Most shamans know how to use them, but not how they
work.  The shaman detector just indicates the potential for magic use.  The
tribal counsel object essentially does psychic vote taking.

The tribal counsel consists of six members and a chief.  The ceremony is done
once a year. Each member has to pass an approval rating via the magical device.
Of those that pass the strongest rating one becomes chief. Those that fail are
removed from the counsel. Replacement members are chosen by the families whose
turn it is to send a representative. A round-robin method is used for each
family to determine when it is their turn to send a representative.  To be
eligible a couple must have had a child.


--------------
Nation Culture
--------------
Time: Epoch 3

Description:
   With the hostile elves and the refugee goblins around the Weejon found
it necessary to consolidate themselves into large groups once again.
The Tribal culture in many ways still exists, but it is more of an extended
family than independant functional unit. Two representatives (appointed by
the chief and shaman) from each tribal counsel form the National parliment.
A similar magical device to that of the tribal one elects the president.
With a similar election process, except the election process only occurs
if the parliment does not give a 2/3 approval rating to the president.

Epoch 3
The weejons grow even more urban during this time. Although there are
some who fear large gathering or believe it is wrong, the population
as a whole is becoming more comfortable. Two large towns have been 
established in the west and a medium size one has been created in
the east.

Innate Abilities:

Innate Weaknesses:
   -3 Body

Description:
   Elves have a strange beauty that Humans consider exotic and appealing.
They tend to be of a lighter coloring among the Nobility and members of
Enclave societies, but seem to follow no rule among the wandering clans
whose members have the whole spectrum of skin, hair, and eye coloring.
Because of the great age that elves can reach, they tend to have a life
view that takes very long and patient methods into account.  The have a
fascination with magic and all elves know at least a bit about it even if
they can not exercise magic due to the fact that it is so widely used in
their societies and they are of such an age as to have had exposure  to
it.  An elf is generally considered immature before 40 and mature after
75.  In between it depends on the individual. The gestation period for
elves is 18 months, most of the extra time is in an expanded first
trimester. After having 3-5 children most elven parents lose the desire
to reproduce, unless a child is lost before they are fully mature.


Empire Culture: Epochs 0-Epoch 2:
The elves want to 'civilize' the world by bringing their culture to everywhere.
They aren't very tolerant of other societies or cultures, and are a deeply
religous people, to their goddess Sylain (magic). They have strict sense of
decency and shows of affection are confined to family and married. Most not
brought up in this culture are unable to detect the gestures and intonations
of voice which indicate someone is a close friend.

Marriages are arranged, with the restriction that the couple must be from
different social classes. the general social classes are the nobility, merchants, 
skilled workers, and unskilled workers.

The nobility must marry one of the worker classes. The government is a monarchy
with the throne passing down to the eldest child. The judicial system is
by popular election, and the laws apply to all citizens. Slavery of elves
is forbidden. Other species are considered as a lower class, and are paid lower
wages, restricted from some places, and not considered citizens. Impressing 
of other species into military service is fairly common.

Magic is a highly regarded artform and all elves strive to learn at least
some magic. As such magic use has become tied to religous ceremonies
and as an indicator of maturity. Some elves view magic as a form of prayer
to Sylain. This has implications on how they are willing to use magic.


Epoch 3

Little is known about what has been happening with the elves. A truce
has been worked out with the elven govenor. There have been rumors
that the elven kingdom has left the elven empire, but as there is little 
communication with the elves this is considered mostly a rumor.
Note: Goblin Deity names are subject to change.

   Goblins are slighty smaller, greyish humaniods. Their

-------
Refugee
-------
Time: Epoch 2

Description:
   Goblins who are refugees from the elves are slightly
paranoid, ever fearful that they will lose their freedom
and be retaken by the elves. Despite this they are generally
'fierce' in their attitude and will do what ever it takes
to survive. They generally avoid contact with the other
humanoids (human and weejon) due to the propoganda they
have heard from the elves. They are trying to settle
into small tribal communities in the North East area
of Corellus. A community will generally consist of about
a House or two close Houses. A goblin's House is very important
to them.  A House is an adopted family which a goblin is invited
into upon reaching maturity. Houses generally are 30-150
members large. If a goblin is not invited into a House by
the third year after reaching maturity they are forced out of
the community.

There are some among them who actively work to help
bring more goblins out of the elves service. There are
also a few 'underground' goblins who are providing
intelligence to the elves in order to bring these
'renegades' back into the fold for their own good.

These goblins are generally distrustful of others, and
dislike elves.

Refugee goblins are more religous than their Empire
counterparts with Szz, Yju, K'lar also being the
primary deities.

------
Empire
------
Time: Epoch 2

Description:
   Empire goblins are moderately content with their life
as second class citizens in the elven empire. They generally
have the same attitudes as the Elven empire. They differ
in their religon with the primary deities being Szz (Death/Trickery),
Yju (Life/Luck) and K'lar (Storms/Night). They are also
a classless society with all goblins being roughly equal
status. Societial position is determined mainly through
wealth. Thus greed is an acceptable social trait among
the Empire goblins.
   There are no Houses among the Empire elves. But family
and extended family is more important.

Epoch 3
A confederacy of sorts has arisen out of the major houses. There is still
much internal strife among the goblins. There is no war between them
and the weejon, but there are still occasional skirmishes between them.
They have had little direct contact with the humans, and are still
very much opposed to the elves. Officially they consider themselves
at war with the Elves, though not much fighting or advances on either
side have occurred.

------------
3.4.1 Aern
------------

Name: Aern
Influence: Forests, Earth
Version: 1.0
Principal Creator(s): Dean Yuen

Personality:
Aern is similar in personality to Life, but Earth is more concerned with only
those beings on Corellus. Earth uniquely cares for plant-life in its own right
rather than just a means to feed other creatures. Aern sees things as the
whole ecosystem. She (Aern is genderless) is patient and stubborn, although she
has proved to be a good mediator between the other elemental deities. She strongly
believes in cycles and in evolution.
Added to the above, Aern is not only stubborn, it generally 
doesn't care about anything else except its job and is very slow to anger.

History:
She cares for ecosystems as a whole and the success of life in general on the
land. She rarely takes an active part against a species except when it
threatens whole ecosystems for no good purpose. She did help against Dragon,
although she is fairly neutral about a reasonable number of smaller dragons.
She will work in small ways against a large dragon population though to protect
the ecosystems.

Species Created:
Most plant life.
Many 'lesser' but necessary species (e.g. worms, bugs, etc)


------------
3.4.2 Amar
------------
Name: Amar
Influence: Judgement, Law, Arbiters, Honor, Nobility
Version: 1.3
Principal Creator(s): Bob Hanson


Personality:
"The patience of Amar" is an often used expression for this god could
outlast anything save for [Time] him/herself.  Amar is very forthright
and his word is binding.  His followers may never lie and are taught to
believe in the "turn the other cheek" philosphy.  They have a very tough
code of ethics.  Amar is often approached by other gods in an attempt to
garner his favor but he can usually see through their ploys.  He is
generally emotionless and his personality can best be described as boring.
However, he does feel a deep sadness for the current world.

Friends:
Vofos because of his similar views.

Enemies:
Demenateez
[Passion] only because [Passion] cannot stand Amar's emotionless personality.

History:
Long ago, when Necessecity spawned Order and Chaos and they in turn gave
birth to emotion, Amar escaped the Time of Madness by offering his services
to Order.  Order was a grand teacher but the teacher's services did not come
cheap.  Order shieled Amar from most of the effects of emotion by protecting
him with the essence of Order and thus the god did not become embroiled in
the struggle taking place among the others.  In return Amar swore to carry
out Order's will.

Now Chaos learned of this and was furious.  Chaos appealed to Necessity who
determined that the purpose required one of the Means to strive for balance.
Necessity took some of the essence of Chaos and infused it into Amar.  Thus
Amar earned his name "The Balancer".  The other gods quickly discoverd that
this made Amar the perfect arbiter for disputes as he would not favor one
side or the other based solely on emotion.  Thus his role was set and the
other gods began to accept his judgement as binding.

As time went on and the god of death, Demenateez, was in the process of
consolidating his power he realized that he needed Amar's aid.  Of course the
Arbiter of the Gods was unwilling to help and instead Demenateez was forced
to trick Amar into releasing part of his hold on balance.  This was one of
the few times that Amar had ever been fooled and the result was catastropic.
balance was displaced and Demenateez was able to create the first Dragon.
This was quickly followed by the creation of other dragons as the other gods
tried to match Demenateez's moves.

Amar solely blames himself for what happened although there was much more to
the plot then Demenateez simply tricking Amar.  Because of this, Amar
perceives the current Dragon situation as horribly unequitable to the other
species.  Although he was able to convince the other gods to get Demenateez
to kill many of the dragons, he still feels that the dragons presence is
too theatening to the weaker species and he hopes to find a way to relieve
the problem.

Species Created:
None



------------
3.4.3 Battle
------------
Name: Battle
Influence: Battle, Personal Excellence
Version: 1.0

Personality:
She is basically friendly to most. She has no pity though and views
difficulties as challenges to be overcome. She pushes everyone hard, most
of all herself though always striving to be better. In physical skills
few even among the deities can best her.

History:
Battle viewed the time of madness as a time to test and push herself to be
better and better. Unfortunately though one time she bit off more than she
could chew. War came to her rescue then and since then has been like a father
to her. She doesn't expend much time in social relationships, instead focuses
most of her time on herself. She for the most part is happy with her existance,
and has no regrets. She tries to encourage the mortals to achieve all that they
can and to push themselves.


------------
3.4.4 Belan
------------
Name: Belan
Influence: Trickery (Fate)
Version: 1.1
Principal Creator(s): Del Hart

Personality:
Belan insists that she is the goddess of Fate, and considers anything
else slander, which she takes very personally. Other than that
neurosis, she is a planner and a schemer looking far down the road to
benefit herself and obtain revenge against those who offend her.
She enjoys elaborate practical jokes and relishes in setting them up
so she looks like an innocent bystander, which she usually succeeds at.

Friends:

Enemies:

History:
Her main tactic during the time of Madness was to set those against
her against each other.
Since she has done pretty much what she pleases. Since they didn't
get titles after the time of Madness she decided she was goddess of
Fate. She is helpful sometimes like finding life's lost artifact for
her or healing War's pet. It was when she was visiting War that she
heard Battle refer to her as goddess of trickery.  She politely but
firmly corrected him. Many years later she started a chain of events
that convinced Battle that he wanted Vofos's artifact. (She didn't
like Vofos as he didn't have a good sense of humor and was difficult
to play tricks on.) She absolutely loved the outcome of that, though
she went with War to the other deities to ask for help. She has
set up many other conflicts in the past with nothing to tip her hand.
She frequently though plays crude harmless tricks which she pretends
to try to cover up, but fails miserably. This is mainly a tactic to
keep the other deities thinking that she doesn't have the skill or
forethought to pull off anything elaborate. She is a perfect actress
and often layers her lies several deep so that after penetrating a
lie the true motive still remains hidden. She is also a good judge
of character and actions that a being will take.

She dislikes the current dragon situation. Partly cause she wasn't
successful in creating a dragon, but mostly cause she finds the
dragons dull and like stuffed shirts, whereas the major species
are more interesting, gullible, useful and fun. She has been
supporting those trying to help the major species claiming that
it is their fate to found great civilizations.

3.4.5 Demenateez
------------
Name: Demenateez        
Influence: Death (the afterlife)
Version: 3
Principal Creator(s): Wade Gustafson 

PERSONALITY:

Demenateez is founded on fear.  He stays powerful by remaining an enigma to
both mortal and god, hiding his motives behind every grave.  He loves to be
feared, and derives his pleasures from it.  He slays thousands with but a
thought and no remorse.  Each dead that he takes in feeds his eternal hunger.
 Even many of the gods fear him.  

While he will not abruptly take the life of a god without provocation in a
form that would harm all the gods, or a good distraction, (such as the time
of madness), he is more than willing to bring death and order disease and
pestilence to the gods followers and worshippers, in effect, weakening the
god.  

He stays in the shadows of most matters involving the gods, except when the
issues deal with his domain, or him personally.  He is self centered and sees
all gods except for Life and Night as lesser beings to be manipulated, used,
and discarded when done.

HISTORY:

Demenateez is one of the ancient gods.  He was brought into being when
Necessity created the gods, and has since been enternal.

When the emotions first began entering the minds of the gods, Demenateez
found his calling in anger, hate, and spite.  Soon after the gods began
striving for their influences during the time of madness, Demenateez did
whatever was needed to eliminate other gods, finding mastery of death while
the other gods failed to see its power, thus siezing the role of death for
himself.

With his power in hand, he went on to the limbo, claiming it as his own.  It
was here that he stumbled upon a source of void .  He was facinated by it, as
it reminded him of Iahnu.  He led the night goddess to the void hoping it
would please her, as well as increase her powerhold within the ranks of the
gods.  She paid it no attention, so Demenateez went deeper within the limbo
seeking to find a better gift.
Demenateez did indeed find another source of void.  Into this void his
essence reached, and pulled forth from it, the first dragon.  He created it,
ultimately, as a tribute to Iahnu, but realized the power of the seemingly
soulless beast, and hid with it deep inside the limbo, only leaving when his
gift of death needed to be given to a god.

During this time, Demenateez taught Dragon his dark ways, and influenced him
with all of his emotions, evil emotions, which Dragon learned all to well. 
The art of killing was tought as too, and Dragon waited, eager for the day he
would leave the limbo.  

The world was then created and the gods began filling it with minor species,
and the prospect of easy kills brought Demenateez back from the limbo, to the
mortal world.  He too tried his hand at creating these minor lifeforms.  He
brought the flies, as hunters, leading him to the dead, and the raven to see
the world from high above.  Then came the major species, the man, the elf,
and so on, but Demenateez found himself unable to create these types of life,
he had drained himself of this ability by spending part of his essence in the
creation of Dragon, and so he called to the gods, and on the mortal world
they met.  He opened the limbo, and let Dragon step forth to the world of
men.

Demenateez's thirst for killing was quickly quenched, as the dragon slew the
species and brought many to extinction.  Demenateez, with his hold on the
dead began drinking their essence, fueling his own powers.  Dragon continued,
and in time, killed Ojei, god of the volcano.  Which angered the gods, and
Dragon was banished by the Phoneix.  As punishment for Dragon's actions,
Demenateez was sentenced by the gods to maintain the limbo for the dead that
Dragon had killed, and all the dead to come, until such a time as they are
judged by Amar on the final destination of their essence, or Necessity itself
comes for them.

Soon, the other gods began creating their "dragons" all of which were but
mockeries of Demenateez's original.  He had enough forsight to see that the
dragons could become a threat to the gods, especially now that they now cared
little for furthering the plans of the dieties.  So Demenateez returned to
his home in the limbo, and began to populate the mortal world with the
undead, a creation of his own, to carry out his dark motives and act as army
to his causes.

With this all in action, he set back, in solitude, save for the dead, to
prepare for the coming of the great war...

3.4.6 Dragon
------------
Name: Dragon 
Influence: elemental
Version: 1.0
Principal Creator(s): Wade Gustafson, Del Hart


The dragon write-up is mostly forwarded from Wade, with some
minor editing by me. The phoneix outline is mostly pretty early
in development, so it is not quite at the same quality as Dragon.


So, ENTER THE DRAGON, (sorry, bad pun...)

Personality:
   
Dragon sees itself above the gods.  It has the worst traits of the all the
gods combined.  Hate, greed, and anger, and it sees no being as anything more
than food for the wicked, to be exploited, controlled, and devoured. 

History: 

At the beginning of the Time Of Madness, Demenateez, the dark god of death
took his home in limbo.  As he traversed the limbo, he came accross a source
of void, an element that remind him of Iahnu, the goddess of night, for whom
he lusted.  He led Iahnu, into the limbo and to the first source of the void,
and the goddess began to harness the void to fuel her own powers. 
Demenateez, hoping to win the favor of Iahnu went deeper within the limbo
searching for another source of void, and when he found it, he drew fourth
from it, a being, seemingly with no soul, for Life had not given one.  This
being became the first Dragon.  Demenateez hid "Dragon" deep within the
limbo, away from the eyes of the gods, where he alone could learn of it ways,
and influence them with his own.

With time, more gods had begun to take their influences, and Purpose created
a world, for them to focus their efforts on, as opposed to destroying
eachother.

The gods began filling this world with their species.  Demenateez too, wanted
a part of this, and created many meaningless things such as the flies, but
they did not compare with the species that the other gods had created. 
Finally, in a jealous rage, Demenateez called to the gods, and on the world
they met.  Demenateez opened a gate to limbo and allowed Dragon to  enter the
world of men, and the gods were in awe.

Dragon wasted no time, infused with the tendancy to kill, from his father, it
decended on the species and brought six to total extinction.  Ojei, a minor
god whom thought Dragon no more powerful than any other of the species, tried
to defend the species which he had created, and might have destroyed Dragon
had it not been for luck, but Dragon did slay the god, without regret, and
without remorse.

This caused outrage amongst the gods, and all fingers pointed at Demenateez
to remove that which he created, for up until that moment, Demenateez had
been defending the actions of Dragon, but now, Dragon had clearly done the
undoable, and became a threat to all of the gods.
[Note: while most of the deities did think Dragon had enough power to
threaten them, they weren't comfortable with the death of Ojei.]

The gods fought many times with Dragon, and each time they destroyed it, only
to find that it soon returned to the mortal world.  It was a creature of the
void, and could not be sent onward to oblivion.  The gods met to discuss ways
to rid the world of Demenateez's creation, and a solution was reached.  
[Note: elementals are difficult to destroy. their physical body can be
dispersed but it will eventually reform, the time to reform is dependant
on the strength of the elemental]

The gods who had created the five remaining major species joined together to
create a being to counteract Dragon, from the four primary elements, and the
souls of their best fallen, they created the Pheonix, and too gave it strength
from the void.  Neither being could truly destroy the other, for both were 
elemental beings, but in time, Pheonix banished Dragon to back to the void from
which it came.  To hold Dragon in the void, Pheonix seperated its souls
leaving that which came from the void there, to keep Dragon in its eternal
prison. Demenateez in turn, was sentenced to maintain the limbo as a place
for the dead to wait for Necessity to take them back.
[Note: The place where Dragon is held was fashioned by the deities as a prison
for him inside one of the major sources of Void. For political reasons
as well as convenience it was necessary for the void portion of Phoneix
to hold Dragon there.]

Other gods, jealous of the shear power of Demenateez's creation, tried to
create their own, more controlable dragons, and gods countered gods, in an
attempt to stop any one from gaining too much power.  With time the dragons
outnumbered the gods, and began to think in ways they had not known.  They
realized that alone they were no match for the gods, but together they could
undo them.  Many dragons began to break free from the control of the gods,
and turned against them.
[Note: Here we need to decide about dragon species, were they offspring
of the Unique Dragons or were they created by the god(s)? ]

Demenateez, laughed at what had happened, seeing it as suitable retribution
for his loss of Dragon, and left the mortal world, for his home in limbo. 
Where he thought he could watch the great war between the gods, the gods, and
the dragons...

3.4.7 Ehvenahn
------------------
Name: Ehvenahn
Influence: Love, Pleasures
Version: 1.1
Principal Creator(s): Wade Gustafson

Pronounced: (e-ve-non)
Personality:

The goddess of love and pleasures, Ehvenahn is a form of true beauty.  She
can be seen in the peace of two lovers nestled together, and in the happiness
of a playing child.  She is generous and forgiving, with the classical "make
love not war" philosophy to life.  To her all things are precious, and
nothing more valuable then the pleasures of life, be them love, sex, drugs,
music, whatever.

History:

With the creation of the first species, came the goddess of love and
pleasures, easing their minds and bodies in an erotic state of bliss.  From
the times the gods warred in the time of madness, she tried to bring
happiness to the species that had filled the world, with no predjudice.  Her
tampering can be seen in even the most warful and evil of the species.
She has little power amonst the gods, save for the lust most feel towards
her, but the powers of love can bring greatness to the mortals.  It is in her
name that families form and beings unite together.  She has always tried to
make peace between mortals and between the gods, but feels that this will
only come, if at all, by the hands of Time himself.
Ehvenahn commonly sends avatars to the world of men to spread her words and
play as cupids.  She often takes a mortal guise and walks amongst them
herself, for she loves the species more than she loves any god.  For most of
the affairs between the gods, she has remained neutral, except on the issues
of the dragons.  She sees the dragons as unloving beasts that are destroying
the well being of the species.  She regrets that Demenateez felt it necessary
to create such a "monster" and truly feels pity for him.
She was the one whom, first brought the concepts of love and marriage to the
mortal species, and strives to ensure that their love will outlast, even
death.

3.4.8 Elementals
----------------

Aern -  Earth 
Sirocco -  Air 
Nogris -  Water 
Solaris -  Fire 


General Elemental History
-------------------------

During the Time of Madness the four elemental deities decided to work together
for their mutual self-preservation. They did not get along well with each
other, but they felt they could trust each other, which was more important.
The void deity didn't feel like working with anyone and went off on his own,
eventually to become lost.

The four chose Corellus as the worldtoid upon which to establish themselves.
Corellus was the most diverse and most potent of the worldtoids. While none of
them could have held Corellus themselves, together they had little trouble
holding it.

As the Time of Madness ended, it was found that Corellus was the most habitable
of all of the worldtoids. Since the species were important to all of the
deities, the elemental deities made agreements which were to be respected in
order to keep Corellus habitable. Tensions between the elemental deities though
was higher than ever. Solaris left to his other worldtoid (the Sun) and the
others retreated to their own domains, to avoid contact as much as possible
with the others.

The last joint project they worked upon was Phoneix, which was necessary to
defeat and control Dragon. They also worked with and were initially brought
together by the creators of the major species. They all have other worldtoids
except for Earth.

3.4.9 Iahnu
----------------
Name: Iahnu
Influence: Night, Moon (some stars), all things dark
Version: 2.0
Principal Creator(s): Dean Yuen

        Personality: Unlike her brother, Sun, her emotions and intentions 
are amost always masked with a cool calm, her voice always of even keel, 
even when suprised. Most things seem to amuse her and she tends not to take
direct action on most things, preffering to go about them indirectly and
discretely. She seems to have a certain soft spot when dealing with 
mortals, though she can be quite cold and vicious at times.
        
        History and stuff: During the time of madness, Night spent much 
of her time in a quiet calm, away from the other dieties, but closely 
watching Sun -apparently making no move. She had spent much time learning 
what she could from Knowledge and Chance during that time, but what she 
learned was a mere fraction of what they know (certainly some of the more 
sensitive material was not given), though through her learnings she did 
come upon some scraps of knowledge that even the two of them don't know 
of. 
>       Death created the first dragon (named Dragon) which he dedicated to
Iahnu's beauty, however she showed no signs of appreciation save for a 
slight smile of amusement which was certainly less than what he expected. 
But saw the uses of such a creature, and so said nothing of it when Dragon
was released upon Corellus, indeed she, like the other gods, began to create 
her own dragons. This led to a steady escalation on various sides by many gods.
 Night had created only 8 other dragons, the two most powerful being Bantus, and
 Mamut. 
        All during the escalation of dragons, the hero king of the 
tribe of man, Olerin, was bestowed a vision showing a mystical place 
where the secret of fire was held. Night had blinded King Olerin for 
stealing the secret of fire, though it is whispered among many circles 
that it was Night who had given Olerin the vision in the first place.
        The pact with Sun: Night and Sun quirreled much over who would 
watch over the mortal world. They quirreled so often that they finaly 
went to Justice to determine who should keep watch over the world, for 
neither had time to do anything but quirrel. Justice listened to both 
sides carefuly, and made a decision. Sun would hold the sky for a period, 
and then Night would take the other half. To make sure both sides were in 
keeping with the agreed pact, Night must hold a lantern (the moon)in a 
cycle, lighting the way for mortals and allowing Sun to see that all was 
well, while Sun would shine only in certain places, allowing shadows, so 
that Night could see that all was well. Every now and then, Night would 
visit Sun during the day to refill her lamp.
        (A more astronomicaly advanced explanation for eclipses, sidereal 
junk, equinoxes, and solstices: Night and Sun still didn't get along, so 
in the pact, they chose altering paths to traverse the world, and because 
their chosen path could not be altered since the pact, sometimes they 
would get in front of each other (solar and lunar eclipses)) 
        
        Enemies: Sun  -Night has no real quirrel with Fire, though 
sometimes their interests may conflict.

        Allies: Iahnu has been known to aid (or even protect) the 
Trickster and Passion, though they are of generaly neutral atitude towards 
each other. 
        Sometimes Iahnu would align herself with Water, Void, or Death 
for varying reasons.

        Of Bantus and the stars: Bantus, the first dragon created by Night.
 Bantus was an incredibly large dragon, which Night had created for the
 purpose of holding up her cloak of night. Bantus proved incapable of 
holding steady the cloak, as he swayed constantly, thus Night was forced 
to place Bantus into a deep sleep and gave him to the care of Earth whom 
uses the the great power stored within his belly to form new material for 
mortals to find. Bantus appears as a range of mountains (or several) and 
moves in his sleep every so often, rousing Earth (earth quakes). 
        Having nothing to support her cloak, Night went to Knowledge for 
his help. Knowledge, told Night that Justice may be able to help, thus 
she went to Justice. Going to Justice, Night asked for help, and without 
a word, Justice struck Night's cloak with his (staff? sceptre? Mace? club?), 
leaving hundreds of stars with which she could hold up her cloak. 
Sometimes, a star would fall from Night's cloak into the mortal world. 
The starstuff, if found bears special properties.
        Note: It probably should be mentioned in the other diety write 
ups (Knowledge, Sun) that they make use of the stars as well.

        Of Mamut, Iahnu's second dragon: Mamut, unlike Bantus, is very 
clever and very disciplined. He has a skin of shadow with which he can 
shape himself into many forms and enter dreams. He has been known to ward 
off evil spirits that visit sleepers during the night. Mamut also is a 
bringer of bad omens, warning those who can interperate dreams, of bad 
things to come.

        Iahnu's views of the Escalation of dragons and such:
        Iahnu saw the escalation, but did not know how disbalancing it 
would become. She is repulsed by the amount of destruction on the land 
and feels the pain of the mortals whome she helped in the creation of. At 
the same time, she does not make it known how she feels about the 
situation and keeps relatively quiet, watching the reactions of the other 
gods before she would make her move.

3.4.10 Morgrius
----------------
Name: Morgrius
Influence: Disease, Plague
Version: 1.0
Principal Creator(s): Wade Gustafson

Morgrius (More-grEE-us)
Personality: 
Morgrius loves to witness pain and suffering, and sees the shed of tears as
drops of pure paradise.  He is a minor god to Demenateez charged with the
mission of spreading disease throughout the world, to send more dead to their
rightful home in the afterlife.  He is humorless and morbid, with spite
towards all mortals and gods, save for his small amount of worshippers, and
his master, Death.

Friends:
Demenateez, the god of Death.

Enemies:

History:
When Demenateez first let the undead back to the lands of the living, they
alone were slow in bringing about the deathrate that he desired, so he took
the darkest soul that he had yet found and gave it status as a minor diety of
plague and disease.  Morgrius not only unleashed a fury of disease upon the
living, but upon the undead as well, using them as walking contagions.
He is weak, even compared to most of the other minor dieties, and a coward
constantly hiding behind the black robes of death.  Most others, be it god or
mortal dispise him.  Of all the other gods, (Death excluded), he most admires
Knowledge, always trying to drain some bit of information from him to
increase his power level.  Knowledge, has been sucessfully repelling his
barages of questions for eons.

3.4.11 Niam
----------------
Name: Niam
Influence: Life
Version: 0.6
Principal Creator(s): Jeff

Personality:
Her personality will be a nurturing, non-confrontational type.  But due to
her strength and connections to all the Gods, she's extremely well respected
and has a level of power with regards to the other Gods that they will not
argue with. She can be very protective of the overall welfare of life in
the worldtoids. She also at times has sympathy for specific creatures.

History:
When Necessity changed things such that mortal life was necessary for the
deities continued existance, it was Life which took the lead and was the
central figure in creating the Great Seed. Then all of the deities helped
the Great Seed become the Tree of Life, which if one walks along its
infinite branches, it is possible to view any type of mortal being
possible.

Life herself draws her strength from the energy of all beings which are
currently living.  She works to promote mortal life, and while she does not
have personal ambitions, she works to keep other deities from hurting
mortal life, sometimes taking preemptive action.

She does not create new species, per se.  She has the forms of all living
creatures the ever were, are, or to be incorporated within her essence,
and trades that knowledge with any of the other gods who need new information
to create the full species.  As such, she understands all living things
in a way even the species creators may not, and uses her energie to help
strengthen and protect them.

3.4.12 Nimisha
----------------
Name: Nimisha
Influence: Time
Version: 1.0
Principal Creator(s): Lynoure Rajam{ki

Personality: Nimisha is calm and quiet. Most of the time she seems to be
sleeping in the weave of time. Nimisha was born when time was born and
therefor probably a very old goddess, but she feels herself very young and
not at all godlike or powerful. She has power, much power over her realm,
the time, still she uses her power over time rarely and carefully.
Only in extreme circumstances she changes the flow of time for a group
of creatures, thought she quite often changes the flow slightly for
invidual creatures.

History: Nimisha survived throught time of Madness by speeding throught
it. She just put all her energy in making her personal time flow as fast
as possible, so everything was over soon. After time of Madness Nimisha
has kept her eyes open and tried to maintain some kind of calm state of
all things.

Friends / Enemies:

Nimisha doesn't usually take sides, so she doesn't have real friends or
enemies. She works together with many gods now and then and tries to
maintain some kind of non-hostile relationship with all. Bolow some
gods worth mentioning:

Amar    -Nimisha likes Amar very much. She likes to think of him as a
brother of hers and loves to work together with him, as both of them
want to maintain Balance.

Vofos   -Nimisha thinks Vofos is a valuable ally. She asks questions
from him and is ready to help him, when he needs her help, unless that
would put Balance into too much danger.

Belan   -Nimisha doesn't like Belan too much. She tries to avoid Belan

and when Belan causes too much misunderstandings between other gods,
Nimisha tries to interfere in somem way.

Sha-Wu  -Sha-Wu amuses Nimisha. They are not really friends, but Nimisha
finds Sha-Wu interesting and different from the others.

3.4.13 Nogris
----------------
Name: Nogris
Influence: Sea, Water
Version: 1.0
Principal Creator(s): John Williams

Personality:

Sea recieved his domain in a deal which he believes was unfavorable to him.
Since he is a very proud being he chose to withdraw almost completely
into his domain, there to carry out his experiments and activities in
isolation from the other gods.
I've been thinking that he may have coveted the power of the life-god(dess),
which is why he spends so much time experimenting with life forms.

Sea is more of a tinkerer and experimenter. Sea also has an engineering point
of view, where he is interested in practical matters.


History:

He has spent a lot of time experimenting with creating species of all sorts.
The great variety of bizarre life forms in the ocean are the results of
his work.  It is said that his experiments are still continuing.  
He created many particularly monstrous and bizarre dragons, but nearly all
of them were killed off by the gods.  It is even rumored that he may still
be creating creatures of dragonlike power, but there has been no proof.

Since withdrawing to his domain, he has become very jealous of his
territories.  Anyone who enters or sails upon the sea had better show
him proper deference, or risk his wrath.

The most notable thing he has done with other gods was to enter into a
pact with Wind, wherein he created clouds for Wind to use in his storms,
in exchange for an amount of control over the skies above the seas.
Wind then further bartered what he had gained with Earth, so that Earth
could create rivers and lakes.  Although Sea still does have some power
over the water in rivers and lakes, he does not concern himself with
any but the very largest of these.

He does not show any concern about who the dragons eat on land, although
his few remaining dragons are among the offenders.

3.4.14 Phoneix
----------------
Name: Phoneix
Influence: elemental
Version: 0.5
Principal Creator(s):

Personality:
Phoneix's personality is at best multiple personalities. The
deities of the 5 major species each choose the soul of the
greatest fallen hero of their specie at that time to integrate
into Phoneix. They tried to integrate as well as they could
into one consciousness, but were only partially successful.
Phoneix has 2 primary goals, help/protect the major species
and not to harm the deities. The first is from the component
souls chosen and the second is a result of how the deities
created it.
[later a description of each of the 5 component personalities]

History:
When Dragon was unleashed on the world the deities of the major
species wanted to protect their creations without directly 
interfering. They saw that elementals were interesting and had
certain desirable characteristics. They believed Dragon's
unsocial attitudes were from a) his creator, b) apparent lack of
soul, at least according to Dem'.
While they were working on Phoneix, Dragon killed a god, this
led them to try and place restrictions on what Phoneix could
do with respect to deities. Those deities not working on Phoneix
started to work on a prison for Dragon.
Dragon and Phoneix fought for a long while, neither being able
to destroy the other permanaently. Finally Phoneix drove Dragon
into the prison, but only the void portion of him could enter.
Phoneix's body split into elementals of the other 4 elements.
Each of the elementals is in constant empathic contact with each
other, and can communicate telepathically if desired. The
4 elementals are greatly reduced in power from their combined
form, yet they still try to help out their respective species,
with all of them occasionally helping void's species because
void is holding Dragon.

3.4.15 Sha-Wu
----------------
Name: Sha-Wu
Influence: Luck, Chance
Version: 1.0
Principal Creator(s): Del Hart

Personality:
Up till the end of the time of Madness Sha-Wu had a likeable
stubborn personality. After the end of the time of Madness though
he slowly became insane. Although not really insane, his perspective
on reality is so different that it appears he is insane.

Friends:

Enemies:

History:
Through the time of Madness Sha-Wu got through mainly on his luck
skill in magic, and associates.  He Lost several friends.  After
becoming associated with Chance he gained a form of premonition, which
allowed him to sense how probability was going to shape events. At
first he tried to use this to his advantage, but every time he tried
it reshifted into something else. Even communicating what he knew
about it in any specific way would shift it. This was maddening for him
and his rage grew and temper was short for many decades. Seeking
release from this curse he tried to commune with Purpose. He instead
contacted Chaos, who showed him that he can not fight or force chance
to conform, that he must submit to it in order to have any control.
(No one except Chaos and Sha-Wu know this)
Subsequently he became increasingly 'insane'.  He seems to have
no rational plan. He has perfect memory, yet does not seem to react
to anything past or present. Sha-Wu can be thought of as a catalyst
for any other the various forces. While most welcome him when he
is with them, he can change at any time for no apparent reason. He
never shows anger or disappointment, just a happy joy of what is now
and that what he must/will do is good. Must/will means that what he
does is always what he claims is what he mush do.

As with most situations he has no understandable position. He has
helped defend 2 villages. In the goblin village he helped defend
goblins severely wounded one of the dragons created by death and night.
He has also shown the way to several other villages for dragons to
find.

3.4.16 Sirocco
----------------
Name: Sirocco
Influence: Storms, Wind
Version: 1.0
Principal Creator(s): John Williams


Personality:
His moods are rather unpredictable most of the time.  He is easy to entreat,
but quick to anger.  He does not usually try to put forth false fronts for his
moods or actions, and does many things based on a whim.

History:
His main enemy is Sun.  They are constantly battling over various regions
of the world, Wind by sending storm and cold, Sun by sending heat.
This conflict is the source of the seasons.  Earth would be involved in
the conflict in order to keep either side from getting the upper hand,
since both sun and rain are needed for things to grow.  Perhaps she 
negotiated a partial truce by giving Sun more control over the south
and Wind more control over the north, but no hard agreement was reached
as evidenced by the weather's irregularity.

I see him as a friend to the dragons and a creator of quite a few,
perhaps initially as a reaction to Sun's creations, and later because
he found that they were good pets/companions.  Even lesser winged dragons
are welcome in his domain.

3.4.17 Solaris
----------------
Name: Solaris
Influence: Day, Sun, Light, Stars
Version: 1.0
Principal Creator(s): Bob Hanson

Personality:
As fiery as his domain, Solaris is quick to anger and slow to forgive.
For obvious reasons, he is often at odds with [Night] and believes that
[Night] is out to destroy him.  Although powerful, he has a self-esteem
problem.  Because of this he has a large following of worshippers and he
expects them to be very vocal in spreading his word.  His hot-headedness
makes him an easy target for manipulation and there is many a time that
Belan has taken advantage of him.  Of course, the fact that Solaris is
infatuated with the goddess could have something to do with it as well.

Friends:
Belan, [Planet/Plants/Nature]

Enemies:
[Night]

History:
During the time of Madness, Solaris' paranoia level was at its worst.
He spent much of his time travelling among the stars to keep hidden
from what was going on around him.  He made appearences only when
necessary to protect his interests and then he would quickly disappear
again.
Solaris has a pact with [Planet/Plants/Nature] because of the latter gods
need for Solaris' cooperation.  Solaris perceives [Planet/Plants/Nature]
as a lower god and will often act condescendingly.  This behavior could
ultimately hurt him if he is not careful.
Solaris was one of the first to create a dragon.  He did so in reaction to
the dragon created by [Night].  He sees the dragons as just another tool
in the grand scheme of thwarting [Night].
Currently Solaris believes, with a little help from Belan, that [Night]
is plotting with War to...

3.4.18 Sylain
----------------
Name: Sylain
Influence: Magic
Version: 1.0
Principal Creator(s): Jeff

Personality:
Magic is ambitious, smart, savy and focused in all of her plans. She isn't
totally happy in her role as balancer between life and magic, and is always
looking for a way to better her position.

History:
When magic came into being at the end of the Time of Madness, Magic saw it as a
powerful source and used her abilities to claim it. She would have preferred
Life or Dem's sources, but she did not want to overreach and end up with
nothing. Her source's strength increases in the short term if there is an
imbalance between Life and Death, but in the long term her source depends on
the continued balance between the two.

She knows more than anyone else about the uses of magic, but she is always
trying to perfect her art.  In that vein, she attempted to create mortal
forms who would be able to carry on and add to her work.

She started with strongly Magical beings, the Faerie Court.  High in power,
but sadly she found her vision incomplete as they lacked the necessary drive
to forward her art.

So she visited Life and took a time apart to study her.  After seeing the
form of the Great Tree, she decided to attempt it again, and created the
Dryads.  Faerie in essence, but bound to the Tree of Life through a link into
a Great Oak.  Unfortunately, she again noticed a flaw, in that though her
new creations were more self-directed, they were also very strongly tied to
the specific fields of Magic dealing with Nature and Faerie.  So, she went
to contemplate yet again ... 

After a time, she saw the things she needed, and in a work of great sensitivity
and brilliance, she laid her plans beneath the stars and created Elven kind.
Here was a species long lived enough to learn the greater magics, driven 
enough to attempt to perfect their craft, and tied to magic without being
bound by it.

3.4.19 Vofos
----------------
Name: Vofos
Influence: Knowlege
Version: 1.0
Principal Creator(s): Del Hart

Personality:
Curious is his personality and knowledge his domain. He is usually
polite, but somewhat aloof, more interested in what ever has piqued
his curiosity than the plans and politics of the other deities. He
has little use for worshippers although he does respect those who
strive to learn in any manner. Vofos believes that beings should have
a sense of honor and dislikes those who manufacture lies or back
down from a course of action that was agreed upon because it is currently
inconvenient. He generally is not sociable, but is usually not hostile
and will discuss theories on just about anything with anyone. Open
minded also describes Vofos well.

Friends:

Enemies:

History:
Vofos avoided most of the fighting during the Madness when many of
the other deities were Lost, by using his wits and avoiding the
politics of the time.
Since the creation of the species Vofos has set up an island far
removed from the mainland where he experiments with different
ecosystems, magic, psionics, and anything else that he wants.
He uses avatars to oversee the experiments, in fact he uses the
most avatars of any of the deities, which is surprising considering
his power level. Other avatars roam the world/universe observing
and learning. His island separates the ecosystems by magic and
a complex labyrinth between each of them. He also has a central
'palace' which contains a vast library and labratory facilities.
He is only in the palace about half the time, preferring to roam
around and test theories 'in the field'.
For an unspecified favor he acquired an artifact from the elemental
deity to create the island, add on when necessary and maintain
the different environments. One time (possibly in the future) the
battle god decided to acquire the artifact to create his own island
and raise a culture devoted to battle. The battle god had 'asked'
Vofos before, but he refused, so while Vofos was 'in the field' 
the battle deity 'borrowed' it, and slew several avatars in the
process. Needless to say Vofos was not happy at his avatars slain
and experiments ruined. After 43 years Vofos decided it was time
to reclaim the artifact. The battle god refused and so Vofos used
a one-shot artifact to transform the battle god into a baby elf.
He left the elf with a elf clan to live as a mortal, having 
temporarily removed his memories. He reclaimed the artifact and
helped the people of the island survive the harsh conditions
there and tranformed it into a moderate land which eventually
became Teropos, a center of great learning and culture before it
was destroyed. The war god was outraged, but did not know how
to return his son to immortal form. The war god appealed for help
but both death and life saw ways to potentially profit from it and
the goddess of magic thought it was a fine joke. The war god 
threatened Vofos, but saw that it would help nothing and that most
of the other deities saw nothing wrong with Vofos's action as
he claimed it would not hurt the battle god. The battle god lived
out his life as a mortal elf, and then upon death regained his
immortal form. War and battle still hold a grudge against Vofos
for this action, but time has soothed it to just a sore topic of
conversation. Battle actually benefited in ways from the experience.
(Of course War and Battle probably have different views of these
 events.)

Vofos is curious about the current situation of dragons dining on
anything village size or bigger. He has little personal attachment
to either the major species or the dragons, although he would rather
not have any extinctions occur.

3.4.20 War
----------------
Name: War
Influence: War
Version: 1.0

Personality:
War has a fiery personality. He an excellent strategist, but can often be
baited into throwing his plans out the window. He is moody at times, swinging
from jolly to belligerent for little reason. For those brave enough though he
can usually be reasoned with, when the fire of his temper cools.

History:
War was well suited for the time of madness and felt at home in the confusion
and chaos. He survived with out any major problems. During the time of madness
he 'adopted' Battle. Battle had been hurt, and War feeling a kinship to Battle
took her under his wing as his adopted daughter. She was a superb warrior and
always was warmly welcomed by War. War favors the species in the conflict with
the dragons since he views the dragons as slaughtering the species and not
engaging in a war.
