TO DO:
  -> update TOC for magic
  SECTION 2   DICE
  SECTION 3   CHARACTER CREATION
    -> Finish filling out Gifts/Foibles costs in sections 3.6 and 9.7.1.1
  SECTION 4   SKILLS
    -> Finish the skills descriptions and verify all costs and default TDs
    -> Add Fatigue ratings to skills (when appropriate)
  SECTION 5   TASKS
    -> revise 5.5 Contested Skill Task Resolution (to allow both opponents to
       roll as an optional rule) and to clarify what TD is.
    -> revise 5.6 Composite Task Resolution (add example)
  SECTION 7   COMBAT
    -> Fill sections "7.6.1 Attack Reach" and "7.6.3 Combat Hex Grid"
    -> Clarify fend
    -> Decide on reach rules
    -> add modifier for uncoordinated attacks against a single defender?
  SECTION 8   MAGIC
    -> Finish the spell creation tables
  SECTION 9   MISCELLANEA
    -> Complete the Affliction rules (and agree upon them...). Then
       move them into the "GENERAL RULES" section
    -> Fill the weapons table 
    -> Add effective and maximum range to all missile weapons
    -> Collapse the Armour types into more generic categories. We currently 
       have 27 armour types, some of which require padding to be used. It 
       would be best if padding was included in the armour weight and 
       resistance and if we could cut down the number of armour to between 
       10 and 15.
    -> Remove or adjust the Fatigue modifiers for armor (to take into account
       the changes in the Fatigue rules). We may want to leave some Fatigue
       modifiers only for armors that are uncomfortable because their weight
       is not well balanced (e.g. chain mail) or because they can easily
       become very hot (e.g. plate mail).
       
*************************************************************************
3.0b1 (never posted)
      -> added Combat 3.0b1 into the alpha 2.0 rules
      -> made a few additional modifications in the rules, especially with
         regard to dice rolls (d10 now ranges from 0 to 9)

3.0b2 -> added Combat 3.0b2.
      -> changed the DEX definition to include fine motricity of the arms, 
         which was necessary for some combat styles and related game balance.
      -> in character creation, moved the choice of the species before the 
         choice of the career, so that it is easier to pay the EP Cost 
         associated with the species.
3.0b3 -> separated the rules from the world specifics
      -> added current versions of templates
      
3.0b4 -> Modified the magic section. Added guidelines for spell creation
         and using other magic types. Added templates to the template
         section.
         '+' at the beginning of the line represents changes.

3.0b5 -> Clarified the reroll method (section 2.4) description.
      -> Added sentence in section 3.2 clarifying Talent scale and species
         modifiers (I hope).
      -> added LIFT and LOAD to the new STR table and deleted the old table.
      -> moved STR table to section 9.4
      -> Rewrite of the Character Creation and Advancement section to
         include Gifts/Foibles as well as a reorganization of material.
      -> Added section 9.3 Affliction (please check this)
      -> Added recovery rules to Affliction
      -> Converted all skill costs to `EP cost' instead of `TEADV' so all
         tables and references are compatable
      -> Added Innate Gifts and Foibles section for species creation to the
         Species Template (section 9.7.1.1)
      -> Fixed minor spelling and wording problems.

3.0b6 -> removed the reference to the efficiency of Talent scores from 
         section 3.2.
      -> reinserted the skill lists (general, combat and magic) in the main
         rules).

3.0b7 -> Added Healing rules (section 9.5)
      -> Made up a Master Skill List and put it in section 9.6
      -> Renamed templates to Appendix A. Renamed other appendices
         accordingly.
      -> Added Fatigue rules (version 1.2) (sectio 9.8)
      -> Added Equipment list (ver 0.2) (section 9.7)
      -> Added optional Training rule (section 4.4.1)
      -> Added skills in Drawing/Painting, Sculpture/Carving, and Wood
         working.
      -> Updated equations for FATIGUE, Affliction, and Death as per
         discussions in DNCORE.
      -> Changed weapons table to include what style is needed to wield each.
      -> Added weapons to the weapons table (and we still need others and
         details)

3.0b8 -> revised the graded outcomes system to replace the multipliers 
         (TDx2, TD/5) by additive offsets (TD+X, TD-X)
      -> corrected section 5.4 refering to resisting poison with an attribute
         check (actually got rid of the entire note about Attribute checks)
      -> Added 7.4.2.1.3 Called Shots (Should it go here?)
      -> Added Target Size modifier to 7.4.2.1.1

3.0b9 (there have been many changes to Core and Combat over the course of
       many internal revisions.)
         CORE
      -> Minor corrections in the Graded Outcomes section
      -> Updated the Task difficulty odds in section 5.3
      -> Clarified slightly the Optional Training rule (4.4.1)
      ->ÊPut back the paragraph about Attribute check, while removing
         the reference to poison (the sample attribute check is now
         "holding one's breath")
      -> Corrected the lift and load values in the STR table (they did not
         fit with the Strength Factor; scaled down the LIFT and LOAD values
         to accomodate changes in the Encumbrance and Lifting rules.
      -> Corrected some wording in "3.2 Talents"
      -> Moved a simplified version of the Strength Table from the appendix 
         to "3.2.3 Strength Table". Since the Strength Table is mainly used 
         for character creation and directly relates to the STR Talent, it 
         makes  sense to have it in the Talents section.
      -> Removed all the species that are not part of the system from the 
         STR Table (both in 9.4 and in 3.2.3). We will have to add our
         species to these table as the species are completed.
      ->ÊChanged the name of the "Running" skill to "Sprinting"
      -> Set the Untrained Penalty for the "Endurance" and "Sprinting" skills
         to 0
      ->ÊChanged the default tasks for "Endurance" and "Sprinting" skills
      -> Added a new section "PRACTICAL RULES" so that we can put rules
         like Fatigue, movement, healing, ... in a better place than
         in the appendix.
      -> Moved Healing from the appendix into the "PRACTICAL RULES" section
      -> Moved the Medicine skill description from the Healing section to
         the description of the Medicine skill in the skills section.
      -> Introduced the new Encumbrance rules (in "3.2.3 Strength Table",
         "9.4 Strength and Size Rating Table" and in "6.1 Encumbrance")
      -> Introduced the new Fatigue rules in section "6.2 Fatigue".
         I left the old Fatigue rules in section () for those who want
         to compare. We should remove them in the following reposts.
      -> Introduced the new Movement rules in section "6.3 Movement"
      -> Introduced basic Falling rules in section "6.5 Falling"
      -> Moved and expanded lifting rules in section "6.6 Lifting Weight"
      -> Added the Fatigue Rating to the movement speeds table of section
         "6.3.1 Movement Speeds". Changed the Fatigue Rating for the
         Base Speed.
      -> Removed "9.7 Old Fatigue Rules"
      -> Changed the dice roll from 2d10* to d10-d10. I modified all TDs
         by -10 to reflect the change and updated the Task difficulty
         odds in section 5.3.
      -> Major changes in "SECTION 3 CHARACTER CREATION"
         -> Beauty is now a Gift/Foible
         -> BODY is now a physical Talent
         -> Talents now cost 20 Talent Points per point of Talent (this
            only changes the conversion ratio between EPs and Talent
            Points. It will also be used for the optional pool of
            points rule when I manage to make it work correctly.
            (Guillaume)]
      -> New skill advancement method based on usage
      -> New skill advancement method based on usage and EP
         (this one is from Dale)
      -> Includes an updated version of the Weapons table.
      -> Includes the simpler Quick & Dirty movement system in section
         "6.3 Movement". The full system is now in section
         "6.4 Advanced Movement (Optional)".
      -> Clarifications to "6.3.1 Chases"
      -> Finished the update of the odds in "5.3 Task Difficulties" with
         numbers from Dale
      -> Changed back section "3.3.1 Buying Talents" to what it was is
         3.0b8.3, except for the conversion ratio between Talent Points
         and EPs which is left at 1 to 20.
      -> Introduced an optional rule to pool Talent Points and EPs in 
         section "3.1 Steps for Completing a Character".
      -> Added a column in Skill Acquisition Costs table to give the cost
         for Talents
      -> Removed "6.4.5 Moving among obstacles", which was far too complex
         to be useable.
      -> Removed "5.2 Relative vs Absolute Tasks" which was more confusing
         than helpful.
      -> Changed the odds in section "5.2 Task Difficulties" so that they
         are calculated relatively to what an experienced Journeyman 
         (skill=10) can do. This seemed better after some early 
         playtesting.
      -> Added a note in "5.4 Contested Skill Task Resolution" about
         the possibility of using the double of the talent value when
         the task is based mainly on the raw capabilities and not on
         any form of experience.
      -> Corrected the medicine skill to make it work with the Healing
         rules.

         COMBAT
      -> Added a short section about fatigue during combat
         ("7.7 Fatigue in Combat")
      -> Moved "7.6 Unarmed Combat" to section 7.5. The previous section
         "7.5 Movement and Distances in Combat" is now in section 7.6.
      -> Changed section "7.6.1 Combat Movement" to correspond with the new
         movement rules.
      -> Added "7.4.2.2.1 Precision" (please take a look at it Roger)
      -> Modified the Death equation to fit with the results of the vote
         on BODY values  
      -> Changed the dice roll from 2d10* to d10-d10. I modified all TDs
         by -10 and BODY to 25 to reflect the change.
      -> Made all necessary changes to accomodate the fact that BODY is
         now a physical Talent that varies from -5 to +5 (for humans)
      -> Replaced beauty by BODY in the physical talents of the sample
         characters (since Beauty is now a Gift/Foible)
      -> Added a note to precision to explain that it can be deadly
         when rolled defense is used.
      -> Added a more detailed explanation of multiple actions in 
         combat (7.4.2.3 Multiple Actions in Combat)
      ->ÊAdded skill modifiers for all-out attack and all-out defense
         in "7.4.2.1.2 Skill Modifiers"
      -> Minor change "7.6.1 Combat Movement" regarding AGI checks for
         moving in combat.

         MAGIC
      -> Corrected some formatting problems and removed all + that denoted
         where Del had added stuff. The new stuff is now fully part of the
         rules
      -> Made necessary changes to reflect the dice roll change from
         2d10* to d10-d10. In fact, I only changed "2d10*" by "d10-d10"
         everywhere in the text as the rules are pretty unclear on the
         task difficulties...

3.0b10 -> introduced the first version of the magic system rewrite
       -> changed back the "5.2 Task Difficulties" to the viewpoint of the
          minimally experienced character, so that skill and talent checks 
          TDs use the same scale.
       -> wrote missile weapon targetting rules 
          (7.4.2.2 Targeting with Missile Weapons)
       -> slightly changed the modifiers for attack and defense when doing an
          all-out attack or all-out defense.
       -> small corrections to the Size Rating table
       -> rewrite of "7.4.2.1.3 Called Shots"

3.0b11 -> More Gifts and Foibles (sections 3.6 and A.1.1)
       -> Armor table changed to more generic armor types (9.6.2 Armour)

SECTION 1     INTRODUCTION

-----------------
1.1 What is DNet?
-----------------

DragonNet RPG
----------------- 
DragonNet (DNet) is a Role Playing Game (RPG) developed by a group of
volunteers over the Internet. The game is donated to the gaming community as
described under copyright and license. We hope that you enjoy our game. We
encourage you to use it; to change parts that don't fit in your game worlds;
to create new monsters, spells and rules; and to share your creative efforts
with other gamers.

Why Another RPG?
----------------
There are a lot of RPG systems out there. Almost everybody has their
favorites. Everybody has played AD&D (tm). There are new games every year.
Why another one? Well, we weren't happy with the other games we've seen
for several reasons. We felt that if we could use what we've learned from
years of gaming experience, we could develop a system that corrected the
mistakes and imbalances of other games. We hope we've accomplished that. 

"First Kill all the Lawyers" - William Shakespeare
---------------------------------------------------

As many of you know, TSR has recently cracked down on the distribution of
user created materials for use with their AD&D (tm) game. The letter
posted to rec.games.frp.dnd written by a TSR lawyer to a sysadmin 
caused quite a stir. Was there a company that provided a game where 
users were encouraged to develop material for the game and use it 
freely? We couldn't find one so we decided to develop our own.

The intellectual property owned by some game company is not what makes
role-playing an enjoyable hobby. (We argue it is their intellectual
property that causes many of the problems!) We decided to develop our own
fantasy RPG that would meet the needs of the net.community. One that could
be enjoyed without fear of legal retaliation. 

Open Systems Development Philosophy
-----------------------------------
Unix is a popular computer operating system for two primary reasons. One:
it's free (usually), and Two it uses an open system architecture. Computer
operating systems and RPG's actually have a lot in common. They are simply
a set of logical rules combined with a syntax. This combination results in
a system where user defined modules interact. RPG mechanics are also a set
of rules and syntax for the purpose of role playing or story-telling. If
Unix can be successful as a free system with open system architecture,
DragonNet should be successful as a free open-system RPG. 

You already know what free means, and it's nice not to have to shell out
$20.00 for the latest RPG game. Not to mention the continual drain on your
pocketbook for the latest supplement. So what does open-system
architecture mean? Well simply it means that you know all the information
that was used to design the system. You are free to tinker with the insides
of the system. You can change it. Improve it. Distribute it. Expand it.
Bend it. Fold it. Mutilate it. Staple and spindle it. 

In fact we knew when we started this project we wouldn't have the time to
fully develop every aspect of a good RPG. We hope you will take the
opportunity to carve out a portion of reality. Study it carefully. Ponder
it as you read through our Designer's Notes. Write up your new material
and distribute it to the gaming world. That is after all why we started
DragonNet. We felt it would serve our own self interest. We want to see
what you can develop. 

Design Philosophy
-----------------
If you want to design materials for use with DragonNet you have two
options. You can develop unnofficial material yourself. Or you can join
the DragonNet team. Either way, you'll want to understand the design
philosophy we employed in creating the Dragon-Net Game. 

The Quest for Realism
---------------------
Almost all of us started RPG's with one of the early RPG systems. It was
fun for a while, but as we progressed they lost some of their charm.
Perhaps our character had progressed to beyond the 10th level and game
balance was forever lost. Maybe we no longer felt we had enough options,
or it seemed stupid that our fighter could dive off a 100 foot cliff into
solid rock and pick himself off the ground with relatively minor injuries.
In any event, we decided we could improve the system. We started by
working within the systems framework. Soon we exhausted all the
possibilities. Many of the problems were fundamental flaws in the games
themselves unable to be easily fixed without causing major problems
somewhere else. Next we moved on to other systems. We tried RuneQuest(tm)
or RoleMaster(tm). Then we moved on to "third generation" games such as
Hero (tm) or G.U.R.P.S. (tm). Still we were unsatisfied. We questioned why.
These games were rich with detail. The realism we craved was there. Why
did they lack the charm of those first RPG sessions? 

The reason we believe is that realism is not the grail RPG designers
should seek. Adding realism for it's own sake takes away the wonder of the
game. The mechanics begin to bog down the flow of play. We lose the drama
inherent in the plot. The story becomes dull. The game unplayed. The true
alignment principle game designers should strive for is elegance. An RPG
can be realistic to the extent that it uses simple, fast moving mechanics.
Gritty realism is less important than plausibility. An RPG is much like a
novel. Many realistic games get bogged down in the mechanics. This is as
dangerous for a GM as concentrating on technique alone would be for a
writer. The RPG system is there to enhance the story. The story is not a
vehicle for the RPG system. 

Simplicity vs. Complexity
-------------------------
Within the context of an elegant game, simplicity is key. When game
mechanics are simple and can be handled quickly they contribute to an
enjoyable role playing session. When they are bulky, get in the way, or
require frequent die rolls or multiple table lookups we lose the sense of
action, the drama of the events happening in the game world. Complexity is
an enemy that must be guarded against. If we fail to be watchful it creeps
into our systems. It destabilizes game balance and slows the play. The
rules drive the game. This is not what a RPG should be. 

Key Development Principles
--------------------------
Simplicity. DragonNet should be a very simple game to play. All the numbers
needed for play should be available on the player's character sheet. NPC
stats should easily fit on a 3x5 card. Table lookups should be infrequent or
non-existent, particularly during play. Only a limited number of dice should
be used (d10 and d6). Dice mechanics should be similar, and there should be
no more than 2 or 3 varieties. Skill and attribute checks should occur in
basically the same manner. Simplicity should not however preclude the
richness of systems enjoyed by experienced players.

Intuitive. DragonNet should be intuitive. Jargon and Acronymns should be
avoided. High die rolls should be good, low rolls bad. Game abstractions
should make sense relative to the real world. This should not be confused
with realism. DNet is not a detailed, gritty, realistic system. Abstractions
have a basis in reality. As an example in AD&D (tm), hit points are an
abstraction that includes luck, skill, endurance and physical health. When you
lose hit points in AD&D (tm) you are not necessarily taking wounds. This kind
of abstraction should be avoided.

Flexible. DragonNet as a licensed game will be available for all GM's to
tinker with. This should be encouraged, even built into the system. Each
section of the game, Character Creation & Advancement, Skills, Combat, Magic,
etc. should have a set of basic rules that are easy to play, understand and
use. Each section should also have a set of Advanced Rules that add flavor to
the game. These advanced rules should allow characters to move seamlessly
between the systems. All advanced rules would be strictly optional. GM's
could pick and choose among the optional rules they will use.

Expandable. DragonNet is an Open-System design. As such, it should be easily
expandable by the user. The game design should be such that player and GM's
can easily add monsters, spells, skills, character types and cultures without
disturbing game balance or violating the integrity of the system.

Quality. DragonNet should be a high quality product. Suitable for
publication by any of the major game publishing companies. It should include
quality color artwork, be well written and meticulously edited. It should be
made available through anonymous ftp as text, postscript, and through www as
hypertext formats.

----------------------
1.3 Terms and Concepts
----------------------
To play a DragonNet game, there are a few terms that must be known. 
We've tried to keep terminology to a minimum, but it inevitably creeps 
in. Where we have specific terms for RPG constructs, we have tried to 
make them as intuitive as possible.


1.3.1 Talent
------------
Talent describes a character's natural ability in a particular area. A 
character's strength talent is a measure of their ability to lift loads, 
carry weight and deal damage in combat. Other systems refer to a 
characters natural abilities as attributes or abilities. We use the term 
Talent (though you may find attribute in certain places in the draft rules).


1.3.2 Training
--------------
Training is the amount of learned experience a character has in a given 
skill or area. This includes formal and informal education, obtained at a 
university or the school of hard knocks. A character gains training 
through practice, study and use of skills. Experience can be used to 
increase a characters training level in a skill.

1.3.3 Skill
-----------
Skill is the effectiveness of a character in a particular area. Skill 
includes both the characters natural talent and his level of training. 

[Skill = Talent (Ta) + Training (Tr)]

DragonNet is a skill based system, so most of a character's abilities 
will be described as skills. 

1.3.4 Heaps
-----------
Heaps are numeric values that start at 0 and go up. High Heap values are
bad and low Heap values are good.

Some Heaps used in DNet:
   Encumbrance
   Injury
   Fatigue

Heaps work similarly to Task Difficulties (See Skills), except that they 
are variable. For example, when a character takes sufficient injury, he makes

a survival check by rolling dice and comparing the result (modified by 
appropriate Talents, skills or Traits) to his Injury heap.

***************************************************************************
SECTION 2     DICE

---------
2.0 Tasks
---------
Characters in roleplaying games are constantly trying to do things. 
Picking pockets, casting spells, haggling the price of an item with a 
shopkeeper, etc. Whenever a character attempts to do something, it is 
referred to as a Task. DragonNet uses the same consistent format for all 
tasks. Whether you are swinging a sword, picking a lock, or fast-talking 
a town guardsman, you will always use the same game mechanics.

-------------------
2.1 Task Resolution
-------------------
Tasks are resolved by rolling dice, adding the characters skill or 
ability to the die roll, and comparing the result to a Task Difficulty. 
If the die roll plus the ability is greater or equal than the difficulty, 
the task succeeds. If it is less, the attempt fails. Optionally, the Game 
Master may use the amount by which the attempt fails or succeeds to 
determine the degree of success or failure.

Two ten sided dice are rolled for task resolution. DragonNet uses an
open-ended die roll method designated d10-d10* (See re-roll method below).

-----------------    
2.2 Weapon Damage
-----------------

Six sided dice are used for weapon IMPACT.

--------------
2.3 Experience
--------------
Experience Points can be awarded with Experience Dice (d6). Some GM's may 
not like this level of randomness, and are free to set EP's as a fixed 
amount as outlined in the section on experience. In that case the dice 
range can be used as a guide.

-----------------
2.4 Reroll Method
-----------------
For Task Resolution, DragonNet uses two ten-sided dice of contrasting colors. 
Each dice can generate a result from 1 to 10: the 0 on the dice is considered
to be a 10.

Before rolling, choose which dice will be the positive dice and which will be
the negative one. In the examples below, the white dice is positive, while
the black one is negative. You then roll the two dice and substract the
negative one from the positive one.

Example:
White dice (+): 6
Black dice (-): 7
Result:        -1

When you roll a 10 on one (or both) dice, you compute the partial result and
reroll the 10, adding or substracting the new roll, as appropriate. If you
also roll a 10 on the reroll, you add it to the partial result and reroll
again. You reroll as long as you keep rolling 10s... or until the GM asks to
verify your dice. ;)

Using this method is denoted as d10-d10 throughout the rules.

Example:
White dice (+):  10
Black dice (-):  2
Partial result:  8
White dice (+):  3
Final result:    11

Example:
White dice (+):  7
Black dice (-):  10
Partial result:  -3
Black dice (-):  3
Final result:    -6

Example:
White dice (+):  10
Black dice (-):  10
Partial result:  0
White dice (+):  10
Black dice (-):  3
Partial result:  7
White dice (+):  1
Final result:    8

***************************************************************************
SECTION 3     CHARACTER CREATION

------------------------------------
3.1 Steps for Completing a Character
------------------------------------
Following is a basic outline describing the steps involved in creating a
character for DragonNet. Each of these steps will be detailed in the
following sections.

Step 1: Ask your GM for the genre of the game (Realistic, Heroic or Highly
        Heroic). Use this genre to determine the number of Talent Points
        (TPs) your character will start out with and use them to buy starting
        Talents (section 3.3.1). If your GM prefers, you may roll randomly
        for starting Talents (section 3.3.2).

Step 2: Ask your GM for the Experience Level of his campaign. With the
        Experience Level use the table in section 3.4 to determine how
        many Experience Points (EPs) your character begins with.
        (Alternatively, your GM may simply assign EP to you instead of
        having you use the table).

Step 3: Select a Species

        Species that can be used as PCs will indicate this in their
        encyclopedia template. Species will also have a value in their
        Template called Cost.  Human Cost = 0. All other species have a
        number relative to humans. Thus if a species has more negatives
        than positives, it will have a negative Cost. If a species has
        more positives than negatives, it will have a positive Cost. Refer to
        individual species descriptions in that part of the rules.

        Subtract Cost from EP.

        - Species will list +/- next to their talents. The +/- represent
          how much better or worse the species average is in that talent
          compared to human. For instance, if an Elf lists +5 PER, this
          means that the average Elven Perception is +5 greater than the
          human average. Species Talent modifiers cannot range higher than 
          +5. Add these Talent modifiers to your character's Talents.

Step 4: Select a Career if you wish. See section 3.5 for more details.
        
Step 5: Select Gifts and/or Foibles if desired (see section 3.6)

        Gifts have a positive EP Cost.
        Foibles have a negative EP Cost.

        Subtract these Costs from EP.

Step 6: Select a skill for the character (see Chapter 4). If the character
        has chosen a career, the skill should fall within one of the EP
        groups in which the character has some EP remaining.

Step 7: Note the Skill Cost (1-5 EP per skill level)

Step 8: Decide what level of Training you want your character to have with
        the skill.

Step 9: Using the Skill Cost and the Desired Training Level, calculate
        the cost by using the value from the skill acquisition costs table
        (section 3.4) or by using the shortcut formula. Subtract this
        number from an EP group to which the skill belongs (Career EP
        or non-Career EP).

Step 10: Repeat steps 6-9 until EP = 0 for all groups or you wish to stop
         purchasing skills.
         Record unused EP on your character sheet for later use.

OPTIONAL:
Step 1-2: Some gamers prefer to create their character using only one set of
          points. If the game master wishes that the players use such a
          method, he can convert the Talent Points into EP using:
          
          Talent EP = (Genre Talent Points)*(Genre Talent Points + 10)
          
          These Talent EP are added to the normal starting EP, and the
          pooled EP are used to buy both Talents and Skills. The cost of
          Talents is calculated as if they were skills with a Base EP Cost
          of 20 (see section 3.4). For example, a Talent of +5 would cost
          300 EP, while a Talent of -3 would yield 120. Optionally, the 
          game master can also decree that negative Talents only yield 
          20 EP per Talent point (-3 would yield 60 EP).
          
          If the career option is used, the characters should buy their 
          Talents first and then divide the remaining EP between their
          career skills and general skills.

-----------
3.2 Talents
-----------

In the DragonNet system, a character is defined by ten primary Talents. 
These are described hereafter and have been split into two categories - 
(1) physical and (2) mental.

Physical: Fitness, Agility, Manual Dexterity, Strength, Body
Mental:   Intelligence, Will Power, Perception, Aura, Psyche
 
Human Talents are in the range -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5.
It should be noted that different player species may have modifiers to some
Talents, thus moving them above or below the 'normal' human range of -5 to +5.

Talent  Description

*Assuming modifiers for species

3.2.1 Physical Talents
----------------------

Agility (AGI)
-------
Agility represents body control (static and motive) and connectivity.
It includes balance, rhythm, and flexibility.
 
Body (BOD)
----
Represents the amount of physical mistreatment that the character can
endure before his vital organs cease to function correctly, i.e. he 
falls unconscious or die. Generally, body is proportional to the
character's size.

Manual dexterity (DEX)
----------------
Manual dexterity includes hand-eye coordination, fine motricity of the 
arms and hands, and sensitivity of touch.
 
Fitness (FIT)
-------
Fitness is an indicator of bodily health (immune system) and metabolic 
efficiency. Running for two hours without halt is a good example of a 
fitness related activity.
 
Strength (STR)
--------
Strength is a rating of physical power, both in its instantaneous 
explosive expression and in its prolonged and measured form.

3.2.2 Mental Talents
--------------------

Aura (AUR)
----
Aura is the non-tangible complement to beauty. It represents a 
character's ability to impress, influence, seduce, command and lead 
people. Qualities such as natural charisma, personal magnetism, and 
sex appeal are greatly influenced by a character's aura.
 
Intelligence (INT)
------------
Intelligence encompasses memory, analytical and reasoning ability, and 
speed of thought. A high intelligence indicates a natural aptitude for 
the generation, retention, and understanding of linear thought.
 
Perception (PER)
----------
Perception includes alertness and observational acuity. A character with 
a high perception score has keen senses and is less likely to be 
surprised by unexpected developments.
 
Psyche (PSY)
--------------
Psyche is the emotional counterpart to intelligence. It rates a 
character's ability to engage in creative, intuitive, spiritual and 
transcendental thought. Amongst other things, Psyche enables interaction 
with the supernatural, including the gods, the spirit of Nature, and the 
mysteries of the universe.
 
Willpower (WIL)
--------------
Willpower is an indicator of self discipline (determination and persistence) 
and mental fortitude (resistance to influence, pain and stress).

3.2.3 Strength Table
--------------------

Use the following table to determine how much your character can carry and
lift based on its strength. It is suggested that you record those numbers
on you character sheet for later use.

---------------------------------------

STR:    Strength Talent.

LIFT:   The weight a character can lift overhead easily.
        (in kg unless otherwise indicated)
        Attempting to lift a weight equal to LIFT overhead has a TD of -5.
        For every increase in weight equal to LOAD STEP, increase TD by 1
        For every decrease in weight equal to LOAD STEP, decrease TD by 1
       
        Shortcut Formula: TD = -5 + ( (Weight-LIFT) / LOAD STEP )

LOAD:   LOAD is the amount of weight a character can carry before he will
        feel the effects of encumbrance.
        (in kg unless otherwise indicated)

        When a character carries a weight equal to or lower than LOAD, his
        Encumbrance Penalty is equal to 0.
        If the weight carried is greater than LOAD, then the Encumbrance
        Penalty is increase by 1 for every increase of weigth equal to
        the LOAD STEP (or a fraction of the load step).
        
        Shortcut Formula: (round up)
          Encumbrance Penalty = (Weight-LOAD) / LOAD STEP
        
        Example: STR = 0; LOAD = 20 kg; LOAD STEP = 2 kg
                 Weight <= 20kg   -> Encumbrance Penalty = 0
                 Weight = 20.5 kg -> Encumbrance Penalty = 1
                 Weight = 22 kg   -> Encumbrance Penalty = 1
                 Weight = 22.5 kg -> Encumbrance Penalty = 2
                 Weight = 24 kg   -> Encumbrance Penalty = 2
                 Weight = 35 kg   -> Encumbrance Penalty = (35-20)/2 = 8
                 
Humanoid Species: an example species of a given strength.


----------------------
3.3 Generating Talents
----------------------
The first step in the character creation process is to generate Talents.
There are two methods for doing this -- buying Talents with a point-cost
method (3.3.1) or randomly rolling for Talents (3.3.2).

3.3.1 Buying Talents
--------------------

A character begins with a number of Talent Points (TP) divided evenly into 
the two attribute categories, i.e. one half of the TPs must be spent on
Talents for Physical attributes and the half on Talents for Mental attributes.

The number of starting TP depends on the genre set by the Game Master:

Highly Heroic -> 20 TP
              -> Average Talent = +2

Heroic        -> 10 TP
              -> Average Talent = +1

Realistic     -> 0 TP
              -> The adventurer is just as good as a normal human
                 (Average Talent = 0)
 
The Talent of each attribute is purchased at a cost equal to the Talent value.
For example, a Talent of +5 in Strength costs five Talent Points, while a
Talent of -2 would yield two Talent Points to be spent on other Attributes.

A character cannot have a Talent over +5 or below -5 before the Species'
modifiers are applied.

OPTIONAL: When creating a character, a player has the choice to distribute
          starting TP into the two categories using any of the following
          breakdowns: (Physical/Mental)
                            60% / 40% (6 TP / 4 TP)*
                            50% / 50% (5 TP / 5 TP)
                            40% / 60% (4 TP / 6 TP)

          *Cost in parenthesis are given for the Heroic genre.
          
OPTIONAL: At least half of the TP must be used when buying Talents in a
          category. Left over TP can be converted to Experience Points using
          a 1 to 20 conversion ration (1 TP = 20 Experience Points). The 
          converted points can only be applied to skills whose primary 
          attribute is a member of the category h(physical or mental) from 
          which the points were converted.
 
3.3.2 Rolling for Attribute Talents
-----------------------------------
To generate values in the -5 to +5 range, the basic die roll method is to roll
2d6 then subtract 7 (i.e. 2d6-7). This methods gives a -5 to +5 distribution
that looks like a linear climbing ramp followed by a linear falling ramp, and
has a mean of 0. The odds of rolling each extreme (-5 or +5) are 1 chance out
of 36 for each roll. On ten rolls, the probability of having at least one +5
is about 25%.

OPTIONAL: 
A simple variant to the method presented above is to roll more dice than 
needed and keep only the best. For example, one could roll 3d6 and keep only 
the two best, ignoring the result of the lowest dice (this result is NOT 
added). The use of this method is left to the discretion of the Game Master.

Once the die rolling method has been chosen (by the Game Master), several 
procedures can be applied to generate a character's attributes. A few are:

1) Make a roll for each attribute in order.

2) Make ten rolls and assign the results to the attributes as you wish.

3) Make eleven or more rolls, drop the lowest and arrange to taste.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Experience Level
   The average experience level of characters in the GM's campaign.
   Starting:   Characters have few skills. Difficult skills have low Tr
               levels.
   Moderate:   Characters have some skills. Difficult skills have moderate
               Tr levels.
   High:       Characters have many skills. Difficult skills have high Tr
               levels.
   Very High:  Characters have lots of skills. Difficult skills have very
               high Tr levels.

EP
   The number of EP associated with the campaign's Experience Level. EP are
   used for selecting a species, buying gifts and foibles, and buying skills.
   
   The EP values listed represent the experience points that a character has
   accumulated throughout his lifetime. It quantifies the  achievements the 
   character has made since childhood and the experience the character has 
   obtained from those achievements.

   GMs are encouraged to assign their own EP values if those listed do not
   fit with the GM's personal rate of awarding experience.

Career EP
   If a player decides to select a Career for his character then EP is
   increased by 10% (rounded up). However, in order to receive this bonus,
   70% of EP must be devoted to skills within the domain of the Career.
   A given career may further specify to which skills portions of that 70%
   must be devoted. The remaining 30% of EP can be used to freely select any
   other skills, including additional career skills.
   
   The "Career EP" column in the table gives the number of experience points 
   that must be spent on career skill (the number preceeding the slash) and
   the number of experience points that can be spent on other skills (the 
   number after the slash).

Maximum Starting Training Level (Optional)
   Listed as an optional rule to control how much Training a player can
   acquire for a skill at character creation. It simulates the fact that at
   lower Experience Levels a character has not had enough time to develop
   skills to high levels of mastery. In particular, harder skills would not
   have been developed as much as the easier skills. If GMs have no problem
   with characters beginning with skills starting out at any Tr level, then
   they can ignore this option.

   The numbers in the table indicate the maximum training level a character
   may advance a given skill to start with. For example, if a character were
   just starting out, and wanted to learn Cooking (a low cost skill costing 
   1 EP (Adv cost) - see the skill lists in the `World' book, Chapter 2 - 
   Skills for more information) and Armourer (a more difficult skill costing 
   4 EP), he could advance Cooking to a maximum level of 10 (at a cost of 
   55 EP - please see Skill Acquisition Costs table below), and Armourer to a 
   maximum level of 4 (at a cost of 40 EP).

The following table can be used to look up the EP cost for advancing a skill
from a Training level of 0 to the desired training level in one step. This
table is most useful when creating a character and buying skills for the first
time.

Skill Acquisition Costs
 Shortcut Formula: 
   EP needed = (Desired Tr) * (Desired Tr + 1) * (EP Cost of skill) / 2

---------+----------------------------------------+------------
Desired  |      Skill Advancement Cost            | Talent Cost

3.5 Careers
-----------

3.5.1 Career Bonus
------------------
Character's who embark upon a career have some small advantages over those
who take a more generic approach. Specifically, upon creation, Characters
receive a 10% bonus to Experience Points (EP's) provided at least 70% of their
EPs are spent on skills in their career areas. 30% of their starting skill
EPs may be spent on any skills. There is no bonus for choosing a career once
play begins.

Choosing a career does not limit a character to a certain set of skills
exclusively, nor prevent a character from gaining skills outside their career
areas. The character will simply have more starting EPs to spend on skills
within their career areas. There is nothing to prevent, for example, a
Soldier character from learning skills from the Magic area at some later time,
provided he has the needed EP.

***************************************************************************
SECTION 4     SKILLS

A skill is an acquired ability, one that a character learns.

--------------------
4.1 Skill Competency
--------------------
A skill is composed of two parts:
   1) Talent   (Ta)  (determined by the attribute relevant to the skill)
   2) Training (Tr)  (determined by experience with the skill)

Thus, Skill = Talent (Ta) + Training (Tr)

Skill    Competency   Description
------   ----------   -----------           
 Tr=0    No Skill     (A character who has no training with a skill.)
 <= 0    Novice       (A character who has Training but low Talent.)
 1-5     Apprentice   (A character being taught a skill.)
 6-10    Journeyman   (A character who has learned his skill.)
11-15    Craftsman    (A character who is proficient with his skill.)
16-20    Adept        (A character who is an expert with his skill.)
21-25    Master       (A character who is a master with his skill.)
 26+     Grandmaster  (A character who is legendary with his skill.)

All skills confer the following abilities:

 - A character who has Tr > 0 in a skill can recognize the use of that skill
   by another.

 - A character who has Tr > 0 in a skill can recognize the Competency level
   of another person with the same skill.

 - A character can determine the actual skill level of another if the
   character's skill level is greater than the other person's.

---------------
4.2 Skill Costs
---------------
All skill costs are measured in Experience Points. The higher the number
of Experience Points, the harder the skill is to learn and master.

Skill Difficulty   Base EP Cost
----------------   ------------
Trivial            1 EP
Easy               2 EP
Average            3 EP
Difficult          4 EP
Very Difficut      5 EP

--------------------------
4.3 Untrained Penalty (UP)
--------------------------
When a character attempts a task for which he has not been trained 
(Skill Competency is 'No Skill', see section 4.1), or to which no skill
is related, he suffers an "Untrained Penalty".

Some skills will have a special UP of Impossible. This indicates that
the skill cannot be attempted when Skill Competency is 'No Skill'.

BASIC RULE: The UP is equal to 5 for all tasks.

OPTIONAL RULE:
The UP is generally equal to 5 but can be changed by the game master.
The game master may set a higher UP for a task that is normally
performed using a skill requiring a lot of knowledge or practice
(Difficult and Very Difficult skills). In the same way, the game master
may reduce or eliminate the UP for tasks that are primarily based on 
attributes (ex: holding one's breath), or that do not benefit much from 
knowledge or practice (Trivial and Easy skills).
               
As a guideline, a UP of twice the Base EP Cost (see section 4.2) of
the related skill is suggested for tasks that are normally performed
using a skill.
      
   UP = 2 * Base EP Cost

---------------------
4.4 Skill Advancement
---------------------
To increase a skill to its next training level, a character must spend
a number of experience points equal to the next training level times
the Base EP Cost (see section 4.2) of the skill. 

Skill Advancement Formula:  EP Cost = Next Tr * Base EP Cost

For example, if Argis the ranger wants to increase his tracking skill 
(Base EP Cost = 4 EP) from training level 8 to training level 9, he
must spend:

EP Cost = Next Tr * Base EP Cost = 9 * 4 EP = 36 EP

For those who prefer not to use the formula, a table is provided.

4.4.1 Optional Advancement Rules
--------------------------------

The methods presented below aim to better model the relations between skill
use, Talents and skill advancement. Some of them can be combined with the
standard method, while others replace it.

4.4.1.1 Advancement by Utilization and EPs (Optional)
-----------------------------------------------------

  To advance a skill to the next training level, a player must first use the
skill and place a utilization mark next to the skill on their character sheet.
A mark may be placed even if the task is failed. (See Optional rule section
5.8). A mark may only be placed if the skill adds to the play of the game 
and is a relevant set of actions to achieve a goal. ie. One group of combat 
for survival is one mark. To open a chest with two locks is one mark, the 
goal being to open the chest. Also no marks are added for automatic success.  
Utilization marks may also be gained by training with someone who has the 
skill at the desired level + 3 (or level +1 if his passes a teaching skill 
TD) for 8 hrs * difficulty = 1 utilization mark. 

A)  When a player wants to add a new skill after character creation they
must receive training to gain utilization marks but may use EP freely.

B)  When a player wants to increase a skill they may at 20% per utilization 
mark of their starting unused EP for each skill.

C)  If a skill goes unexercised and untrained for six months or more the
skill will lose its current utilization marks.

(Very Optional)
D)  If a skill goes unexercised for six months or more the skill will
operate at one level lower then the current training level. This operational
loss remains in effect until the player receives three utilization marks at
their current level. 
(Note: No new EP needs to be spent to regain your current skill level.)

E) If a skill has no utilization marks, the player may not increase that
skill. For each utilization mark above five the player may add one to his
advancement check. (See Optional rule section 4.4.1)

F) If the advancement check is failed the player may not increase his skill 
level and may try again after gaining more utilization marks. When GM deems
it an appropriate time.

G)  After increasing a TR level all utilization marks for that skill are
erased and utilization marks start fresh for the new training level.

For the examples below Roland has 100 EP

1) Roland wants to add a new skill of swimming he may if he trains for 24 
hrs. with some who has a swimming skill of four or more.

2) Roland wants to increase his running skill but has no utilization marks.
He may not. But he may train to gain utilization marks.

3) Roland wants to increase his acting skill to 4 but has not used it in a
year. He may not, and his acting skill will operate at his current TR - 1
until he receives three utilization marks or the GM allows him to seek
training from a teacher with acting skill of seven or more to gain three 
utilization marks.

4) Roland wants to increase his climbing and cooking skills and has two
utilization marks for each skill. He may use up to 40 EP for each skill and
erases all his utilization marks for the skill if/when he increases that TR
level. (Note: If he wished to raise his climbing skill to TR 11 he must
either gain 10 more EP or gain one more utilization mark in climbing.)

5) Roland wants to increase his One-Handed Weapons skills and has
eight utilization marks. He may use as much of his EP as he wants and
adds three to his training check then erases all his One-Handed Weapon
utilization marks if/when he increases his TR level.

4.4.1.2 Advancement Check (Optional)
------------------------------------

This rule can be used either with the standard advancement rule or the
advancement from use and EPs rule.

When a PC is ready to train a skill (he has enough EP to advance a Tr level),
he must make an Advancement check.

Training:  d10-d10 + Adv Ta >= -10 + Desired Tr level + Base EP Cost

If the advancement check is successful, the PC gains another Tr level.

If the advancement check is unsuccessful, the PC has two options:

1. The PC must wait until he or she has received twice the number of base 
   experience points for the skill in question (see example below).
   (The PC retains his EP)

2. Pay additional EP equal to the TD minus the result of the die roll.

Ex. Ronan has STR 5, AGI -3, and 100 Experience Points.
    He wants to increase his Running skill from Tr 14 to Tr 15 and his
    Climbing skill from Tr 5 to Tr 6.

    He attempts an advancement check for Running:
    Running,  Base EP Cost = 3, Adv Ta STR
    d10-d10 + 5 >= -10 + 15 + 3
    He rolls a 6, for a total of 11. His attempt is successful and he decreases 
    his EP pool by 15 * 3 = 45 EP. He now has 55 EP left.

    Ronan next attempts an advancement check for his Climbing skill:
    Climbing, Base EP Cost = 4, Adv Ta AGI
    d10-d10 + -3 >= -10 + 6 + 4
    He rolls an 1, for a total of -2. His attempt is unsuccessful.
    Ronan must decide between option 1 or 2 above:

    1. He can now either wait until he earns eight (8) more EP 
       before making another Climbing advancement check (climbing has 
       a Base EP Cost of 4, so 2*4=8). His EP remain at 55.

    2. He can pay additional EP equal to the difference between the TD and
       the result of his roll:
       0 (TD) minus -2 (the 1 he rolled plus his -3 Talent) = 2.
       Thus the total cost to move from Tr 5 to Tr 6 would be 
       6*4 + 2 = 24 + 2 = 26 EP leaving Ronan with 29 EP.

4.4.1.3 Advancement by Utilization Only (Optional)
--------------------------------------------------

For those who feel that Experience Points do not model correctly the link
between skill use and skill improvement, an alternate advancement method
is provided. If you use this method, you should not use EPs, even if a mix
of the two is possible.

Each time your character successfully uses a skill in a relevant situation,
put a check mark next to the skill. Your character doesn't gain any check
mark for tasks with automatic success (if his skill is 10 points higher than
the task difficulty). However, your character also gains a check mark if he
rolls a mishap (if Graded Outcomes are used), since one also learns from his
mistakes.

If a skill has accumulated 5 check marks, you can make a skill advancement
check the next time your character gets a respite of at least a day (or at
any other time judged appropriate by the GM). After the check, remove the 5
check marks. The check is:

d10-d10 + Advancement Talent >= -11 + 2 * EP Cost + Next Training Level

To accelerate the calculations, it is suggested that you write the 
-11 + 2 * EP Cost value on your character sheet next to the EP Cost the first 
time you make an advancement check.

If the check is successful, increase your skill to the next Training Level.
If not, then your character has not learned enough from his adventuring 
experience and his skill does not improve.

For example, Ronan has been involved in a few fights in the last weeks 
and it is time for him to improve is "One-Handed Weapon & Shield" style.
His current Training is 8 and the style has an EP Cost of 4 and AGI as the
advancement Talent. To improve his style, he will have to pass the check:

d10-d10 + AGI >= -11 + 2 * EP Cost + Next Training Level
d10-d10 + 2   >= -11 + 2 * 4 + 9
d10-d10 + 2   >=  6

Ronan rolls 8, to which his AGI of 2 is added, for a total roll of 10. The
check is successful and Ronan's Training in "One-Handed Weapon & Shield" is
now of 9.

Your character can also train in a skill to improve it. The skill gains one
check mark for each full day (8 hours) per Training level that the character
spends learning with an instructor. For example, to increase a skill from
Training 8 to Training 9, a character would have to spend 9 days of training
with a tutor for each check mark. If a character trains without a tutor, it
takes twice as long to earn each check mark and a mishap on the check
indicates that he has developped a bad habit and has lost one Training Level
(if Graded Outcomes are used).

Your character only gets check marks for his skills when they are used in
relevant situations. A relevant situation is a situation that adds to the
game, that helps build the dramatic tension even if only in a small way. If
a character decides to open the lock of his bedroom just to improve his open
locks skill, he does not gain a check mark for every successful attempt. The
situation does not add anything to the game and the character's actions thus
fall under self-training. For combat skills, any skill or style that is used
within a combat automatically gains a check mark at the end of combat,
unless the GM says otherwise. Your character does not get a check mark for
every successful hit, but still gets a check mark even if he does not hit.

---------------------

Acrobatics
----------
Confers the ability to swing from a chandelier, somersault through a stained
glass window, and land on one's horse, ready to make a getaway. Can be used
in combat to dodge or reduce the effects of a blow.

openings, hide in absurdly small containers or edifices, and escape from
bonds.

Endurance
---------

and/or mentally draining tasks. A swimmer nears exhaustion towards the end
of long swim; they apply their endurance skill, and if successful, can
continue swimming anew, as if refreshed for half as long again. Successive
uses of the skill increase task difficulty and reduce prolongation span.

Falling
-------
Enables the reduction of falling damage by such methods as slowing the rate
of descent by incidental surface contact, harm minimising impact postures,
and "dodging the spikes/aiming for the soft bits."

Juggling
--------
Confers an ability to manipulate balls and other objects primarily for
entertainment purposes. Subsumes minor sleight-of-hand techniques.

Jumping

Confers the ability to attenuate pain, stop bleeding, and prevent further
injury as a result of cuts, bruises, abrasions, burns, broken and sprained
limbs, bites and stings (see section 6.4 - Healing*).

Enables two types of healing - emergency and palliative.

Emergency healing can lessen the severity of a new wound. Treatment must
commence within 1 minute following the wounding. TD is 5 per point of damage
the healer attempts to recover. Add 5 to TD for each attempt after the first
on the same character inside the same day. Example: Ronan sustains a 12 point
wound; Kara attempts to reduce it to a 9 point wound. TD will be 15. If Ronan
had been treated by Kara once already on that day, TD would instead be 20.

Palliative healing enables natural healing to occur at the rate of 20% of
(BOD+25) per day of low activity and 10% of (BOD+25) per day of moderate
activity, provided the care-giver makes a Healing roll at TD 5 for each
patient under his care.

Medicine skill can also be use to alleviate the effects of poisoning and to
diagnose and treat illnesses. A Healer who comes to the aid of a poisoned or
diseased individual can attempt to reduce the VIRULENCE of the affliction. The
Healer's TD for this action is 5 per point of VIRULENCE the Healer attempts to
remove. Example Ronan drinks poison with a VIRULENCE of 25; Kara attempts to
reduce the VIRULENCE to 20. Kara's TD would be 25. This must be done before
the poisoned character begins to suffer the full effects of the affliction
(see Affliction in section 9.3*).

***************************************************************************
SECTION 5     TASKS

A Task is a situation in which a character applies his abilities to
accomplish some action. A character may use his Talent or a skill when
attempting to resolve the Task.

-------------------
5.1 Task Resolution
-------------------
The process of resolving a Task is called Task Resolution. It is done via a
roll of the dice. The applicable Skill is then added to the die roll and the
result must be greater than or equal to the Task Difficulty  set by the GM.
Thus the standard Task Resolution Formula is:

Formula: d10-d10 + Skill >= TD

where: d10-d10 = Standard Dice Roll
  and: Skill   = Ta + Tr
  and: TD      = Task Difficulty

If situational modifiers reduce a Task Difficulty to -10 or less, a Task
Resolution roll is not required; the outcome is an automatic success. 

Similarly, and especially in non-crisis situations, a GM may waive the
requirement for a task resolution roll when a character's skill rating is
5 points over the Task Difficulty rating e.g., Skill 6, TD 1.

---------------------
5.2 Task Difficulties
---------------------
To aid the GM in determining task difficulties, the following task 
difficulties have been established relative to what an average 
character (Ta = 0) with minimal training in a skill (Tr = 1) can
accomplish. Therefore, the values were derived from the following 
task resolution formula:

d10-d10 + 1 >= TD

Thus, when assigning a difficulty to a task, the Game Master should set
the Task Difficulty as if the task was being attempted by a Ta = 0, Tr = 1
character. The Game Master should not base the difficulty on the skill
level of the character attempting the task. In other words, figure out what
the task is like, then use the table below to find the description that
best fits the Task. With this description, use the TD value listed.

For example, climbing a moss covered wall by someone with Ta = 0, Tr = 1
could be described as tricky. Tricky is listed under the "Could also be
described as" column for Difficult. The TD associated with a Difficult
Task is 5. Thus no matter what the Skill of a character attempting to
climb a moss covered wall, the Task Difficulty is 5.

If a character with Skill 3 in Climb Walls attempts to climb the moss
covered wall, he uses the formula: d10-d10 + 3 >= 5.

If a character with Skill 10 in Climb Walls attempts to climb the moss
covered wall, he uses the formula: d10-d10 + 10 >= 5.

------------------------------------------------------
Description      TD  Odds*  Could also be described as
------------------------------------------------------
Easy.............-5  89%    Routine, Simple, Trivial
Average...........0  63%    Engaging, Fair, Intermediate
Difficult.........5  25%    Difficult, Tough, Tricky
Very Difficult...10  6%     Challenging, Demanding, Tasking, Vexing
Extremely Diff...15  2.4%   Exacting, Formidable, Punishing

Limit............20  0.6%   Extreme, Ballistic
Crushing.........25         Backbreaking, Monumental
Herculean........30         Epic, Staggering, Superhuman
Gargantuan.......35         Stupefying
Titanic..........40         Awesome

Unbelievable.....50         Impossible
Inconceivable....60         Shattering
God-like.........70         Legendary, Mythic
Immortal.........80         Celestial, Eternal
Cosmic..........100         Transcendental

*Odds are calculated for a Talent = 0, Training = 1 character.

-----------------------------------------
5.3 Task Resolution when no skill is used
-----------------------------------------
If a character attempts a task for which he does not possess a skill or to
which no skill is related, he uses (Ta - UP) in place of Skill and the Task 
Resolution Formula becomes:

Formula:  d10-d10 + (Ta - UP) >= TD

where UP is the "Untrained" Penalty.

UP is generally equal to 5 but see Section 4.3 for GM options.

Note: Attributes checks are conducted using this method, since they do not
involve a skill. Because it is sometimes difficult to tell if a task could
be done using a skill or not, it is the responsibility of the GM to set an
UP of 0 for what he feels to be a true "Attribute Check". An example of a
true attribute check would be holding one's breath to which a character's
Fitness would be applied using the formula d10-d10 + FIT >= TD.

-----------------------------------
5.4 Contested Skill Task Resolution
-----------------------------------
Formula: d10-d10 + Skill^ >= TD + Opponent's Skill^

^If contestant is not using a skill (generally because he is untrained), 
replace Skill with (Ta - UP).

OPTIONAL: If a contested task is based on Talent only, i.e. it does not
  rely on the use of a skill, the game master may wish to double the value
  of each opponent's talent, to reflect the fact that the task depends more
  on their raw capabilities than on any form of experience. For example,
  a contest of Strength between Joe Blow and Conan could be resolved using:
  
  d10-d10 + 2 * Joe Blow's STR >= 2 * Conan's STR

-----------------------------
5.5 Composite Task Resolution
-----------------------------
There is a TD for the task as a whole.  A roll is made at an effective
skill equal to the sum of his skills which are involved in the task against
that TD.  If the roll succeeds, the task succeeds.  If the roll fails, the
task fails.

---------------------
5.6 Combining efforts
---------------------
When many characters unite their strength, intelligence, etc. to accomplish
a Task, they are often more efficient than if they were trying to
accomplish the Task independently. In such a situation, the success of the
attempted Task is obtained by having each character roll independently
against the Task Difficulty. The TD is lowered by 1 for every character
working on the Task beyond the first. The Task Resolution Formula for each
character is therefore:

d10-d10 + Skill >= TD - (N-1)

where N is the number of characters attempting the task.

The Task is successful if at least one of the characters makes his roll.

The GM must decide, based on the Task, if more than one character can
attempt the Task. If he decides that more than one character can attempt 
the Task, he must then decide the maximum number of characters that can 
take part in attempting the Task.

-------------------
5.7 Graded outcomes (Optional)
-------------------
For GMs who prefer a slightly less absolute (success or failure) system of
determining the result of Task Resolution, the following system is provided
as an option for measuring the degree of success or failure.

Bonus:    roll >= TD + 10
Success:  TD + 1 <= roll <= TD + 9
Partial:  TD - 1 <= roll <= TD
Failure:  TD - 9 <= roll <= TD - 2
Mishap:   roll <= TD - 10

Bonus   - A really good outcome which surpasses normal expectations.
          If the GM cannot think of a reasonable Bonus then the outcome
          should simply be treated as a Success.
Success - A successful outcome which achieves the desired result.
Partial - An outcome that could be categorized as somewhere between success
          and failure. The exact result is left to GM discretion. As a
          guideline, if roll = TD, then the GM should make sure that the end
          result is a success. Likewise, if roll = TD - 1, then the end
          result should be treated as a failure.
Failure - An unsuccessful outcome which does not achieve the desired result.
Mishap  - A particularly bad failure that exposes the character to additional
          misfortune, harm, penalty or confusion. If the GM cannot think of
          a reasonable Mishap then the outcome should simply be treated as a
          Failure.

Example:
Shardra the Ranger has Tracking 4. She tries picking up the trail of a
wounded bandit. The DM decides that this will be hard, as it's been raining.
The Task Resolution formula becomes:

d10-d10 + 4 >= 5

If Shardra's player's total roll is 15 or higher, a Bonus, not only does
Shardra pick up the trail, she also picks up the overlying trail of a
pursuing wolverine.

If she rolls 7 to 14, a Success, Shardra picks up the bandit's trail.

If she rolls 4 or -5, a Partial, Shardra only picks up enough of the trail
to determine the general direction taken by the bandit.

If she rolls -5 to 3, a Failure, Shardra is unable to pick up the trail
because it has been washed away.

If she rolls a -5 or less, a Mishap, Shardra picks up the wrong trail that
leads her in a totally different direction.

**************************************************************************
SECTION 6   GENERAL RULES

---------------
6.1 Encumbrance
---------------

The load that each character can carry without ill effects varies with his
Strength and is given in the Strength Table. When a character is loaded with
more weight than his Strength allows, his Fatigue rises faster than if he
was normally loaded.

The additional Fatigue that a character suffers when he is heavily loaded is
equal to the Encumbrance penalty, which is calculated from the LOAD and LOAD
STEP values of the Strength Table. When the carried weight is lower than or
equal to the character's allowed LOAD, then the Encumbrance Penalty is equal
to O. When the weight carried is greater than this LOAD, the Encumbrance
Penalty is increased by one for every increment of weight equal to LOAD STEP
(or fraction of LOAD STEP).

Encumbrance Penalty = (Weight-LOAD) / LOAD STEP        (round up)

For example, a character with STR = 2 can normally carry 35 kg and has a LOAD
STEP of 3.5 kg. If the character chooses to carry 40 kg, i.e. he carries 5 kg
more than allowed, he faces an Encumbrance Penalty of 2.

Encumbrance Penalty = (40 kg - 35 kg) / 3.5 kg
                    = 5 kg / 3.5 kg
                    = 1.43            
                    = 2 (rounded up)

Each time this character will increase his Fatigue heap, he will increase it
by 3 (1 plus the Encumbrance Penalty). See the Fatigue rules for more details.

The encumbrance system only takes into account the mass of items, not their
bulkiness. As always, a gamemaster may state that the character suffers an
additional penalty on his skill checks because he is loaded with large
items. For example, a game master has the right to impose a penalty
of 10 on all skill checks to a character who is carrying a canoe, even if
the character has the strength to do it. This is left to each game master, as 
we feel that such situations are not very common and that threating them 
here would just add unnecessary complexity to the rules.

OPTIONAL: The game master can decide that the Encumbrance Penalty is also
applied on some or all skills checks in addition to contributing to Fatigue;
he can also decide that Encumbrance only affects skill checks if the Fatigue
system is not used. When the Encumbrance Penalty is applied on a skill check,
the task difficulty is increased by the value of the Encumbrance Penalty. For
example, if the character from the example above wants to jump over a 1.5
meters fence while carrying 40 kg, the game master can decide to apply the
Encumbrance Penalty on the skill check:

d10-d10 + Jumping Skill >= Task Difficulty + Fatigue + Encumbrance Penalty

-----------
6.2 Fatigue
-----------

6.2.1 Efforts
-------------

Each time a character performs an action, he accumulates Fatigue, be it mental
or physical. This accumulated Fatigue makes it harder for him to perform
subsequent actions. At some point, he is too fatigued to do anything correctly
and has to rest. (For simplicity, both mental and physical fatigue are
encompassed by the Fatigue heap).

Some skills will tire a character faster than others. For example, reading
is less draining that moving 10 kg rocks to build a wall. Thus, the person
moving rocks will get tired much faster than the person who is reading.

To take this into account, each character has a Fatigue heap, which is
initially at 0 when he is fully rested and which increases as the character
performs various activities. The more exacting these activities are, the
faster the Fatigue heap increases.

Taking a second look at our above example, we could qualify reading as a light
effort, while moving rocks would be a moderate exercise. The character moving
rocks would thus have to increase is Fatigue every 15 minutes, while the one
reading would only increase it every hour (see the table below).

The Fatigue heap is always increased by 1 plus the Encumbrance Penalty (see
section "6.1 Encumbrance"*) each time it is augmented, no matter which
activity is performed. The frequency at which the Fatigue heap is increased
depends on the effort required by the skill or activity. In the case of
skills, one or more Fatigue Ratings will be associated with various uses of
the skill, which makes it easy to find the Fatigue increment frequency. For
movement, this frequency depends on the movement speed and the appropriate
rules can be found in "6.3 Movement"*. As usual, the game master can always
change the frequency at which Fatigue is increased.

While many skills will have one or Fatigue ratings associated with them, the
game master will often have to determine how wearing is a task. In that
case, we recommend that the game master describes the effort required in words
and then associates this effort with the appropriate frequency for increasing
Fatigue. For example, a task that requires a moderate-heavy effort would
require to increase the Fatigue heap every 4 minutes.

...          ...            1 round                  (10)
----------------------------------------------------------

Note: the Fatigue system is optional for most skill checks but is recommended
for the magic and movement systems. In the magic system, Fatigue limits the
number of spells that can be cast, while in the movement system it limits the
distance that can be covered. If you do not use Fatigue for magic or movement,
you will end up with an insanely heroic setting (where characters can sprint
for 100 km or cast 100 spells in a row...).

6.2.2 Recuperation
------------------

A resting character recovers one Fatigue point every 15 minutes. A sleeping
character recovers one Fatigue point every 8 minutes (or two every 15
minutes). Samples activities that can be considered as resting are: talking,
eating, sitting, meditating, ... Of course, the character must not perform
another activity at the same time.

------------
6.3 Movement
------------

There are five basic speeds for characters movement. The base speed is a
very slow walk, the walking speed is a good long distance pace and the
running speed is a normal jogging. The sprinting speed is the highest speed
at which most characters can go and the maximum speed is the absolute
maximum speed at which a member of a given species can go (for humans, the
maximum speed is that of olympic sprinters).

+-------------+----------------------+-----------+-------------+
|             |         Human        |           |             |
|             |  km/hour    m/round  |  Base TD  | TD increase |
+-------------+----------------------+-----------+-------------+
| Base        |     3           5    |   -5      | 1/hour      |
| Walking     |     6          10    |   -5      | 1/hour      |
| Running     |    12          20    |   -5      | 4/hour      |
| Sprinting*  |    24          40    |   -5      | 1/10 rounds |
| Max**       |    36          60    |   15      | 1/round     |
+-------------+----------------------+-----------+-------------+

Characters have to make movement checks periodically to continue moving at
the same speed. The task difficulty is increased before making the movement
check.

For speeds below the sprinting speed, the check is made using the Endurance
skill:

d10-d10 + Endurance >= Movement TD

For speed at or over the sprinting speed, the check is made using the
Sprinting skill:

d10-d10 + Endurance >= Movement TD

If a character fails a check, he must slow down. If he was running he starts
to walk, if he was sprinting he goes down to jogging, ... The task
difficulty of the movement check remains the same (except if the character
goes from max speed to sprinting, in which case the TD is reduced by 10).

When the character wants to move at the maximum speed, he must make an
initial movement check. Failure indicates that he can move at most at the
sprinting speed. The task difficulty is not increased before this initial
check.

The game master is free to change the period at which the checks are made,
converting the TD increase appropriately (Running could require one check
per 15 minutes, with a TD increase of 1). More complete movement rules are
provided in section "6.4 Advancement Movement".

6.3.1 Chases
------------

If a chase takes place in a crowded environment, the participants must make
an additional AGI check every round. This check is made against the current
movement TD:

d10-d10 + AGI >= Movement TD

Each participant that passes the check can move at the full sprinting speed
or over, otherwise he can only move at the running speed or less. Of course,
if the character attempts to go over the sprinting speed, he must have
passed a movement check before he can make the AGI check.

If the graded outcomes system is used, a partial indicates that the
participant moves a bit slower than sprinting (generally sprinting minus
base, but the GM can change this). A mishap indicates that he has tripped,
or any other unfortunate event that the GM can devise, while a bonus allows
him to cover an extra distance equal to his base speed.

If the chase occurs on clear and level ground, the same method can be used
except that AGI is replaced by STR in the check...

--------------------------------
6.4 Advanced Movement (Optional)
--------------------------------

The movement rules detailed below attempt to cover in a sensible manner most
game situations where movement plays a critical part. However, they might be
cumbersome in situations where movement is not critical and the game master is
free to use them when and as he wishes. It is only suggested that he employs
the standard movement speeds (base, walking, running, sprinting and maximum).

6.4.1 Movement Speeds
---------------------

Movement speeds are divided in 5 broad categories: base, walking, running and 
sprinting and maximum. 

The base movement speed is the reference from which the three others are
calculated. The speed of a character in a melee combat situation is also equal
to the base speed (see "7.6.1 Movement in Combat").

The walking speed is equal to a good but sustainable walking pace, the running
speed is a moderate jogging and the sprinting speed is a hurried run. For
comparison purposes, olympic marathoneers runners move at a pace between
running and sprinting (~19 km/h) and the maximum movement rate listed is that
of the olympic sprinters (100 meters in 10 seconds).

In order to simplify the rules, it is considered that all members of a species
can sustain the speeds given in the table below, for a short period of time
(until their first movement check).

+-------------+----------------------+------------------------+---------+
|             |         Human        |      Other Species     | Fatigue |

+-------------+----------------------+------------------------+---------+
*: 100 meters in 15 secs
**: 100 meters in 10 secs

6.4.2 Movement Checks
---------------------

A character must do periodic movement checks to see if he can continue to
move at a given speed despite the accumulated fatigue. The checks are
done using:

d10-d10 + Training + Talent >= -5 + Fatigue

At the end of each movement period, the character's Fatigue heap must be
increased by one plus his Encumbrance Penalty. The check is made after fatigue
has been increased. The Talent that is used in the check depends on the speed
at which the character goes: FIT for speeds below Sprinting and STR for speeds
above that. The character's training in "Endurance" or "Sprinting" is also
added to the roll (see "6.3.4 Movement Skills").

If the character's roll added to his Talent and Training is greater than his
accumulated Fatigue minus 5, then the character can continue running at the
same speed. If not, then the character must slow down by his base speed (a
human running at 12 km/h would slow down by 3 km/h and would thus end up at 9
km/h). A character can accelerate at any time, as long as he has been
successful in his last movement check.

Note that Fatigue is necessary for the movement system, even if it is not used
in other parts of the system. Using Fatigue with the movement mechanics gives
pretty realistic results.

While the base TD is -5 up to the sprinting speed, the frequency of the checks
changes with the movement rate. For example, a character needs to check only
once per hour when walking but must make a check every minute when sprinting.
The faster the character goes, the faster he gets fatigued.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Activity level     Check frequency/           Movement rate      Fatigue

                   2 minutes                  7*Base                 (6)
Heavy              1 minute (10 rounds)       Sprinting              (7)
Strenuous          5 rounds (30 seconds)      9*Base                 (8)
                   3 rounds                   10*Base                (9)
                   1 round                    11*Base or more       (10)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, the frequency of the checks double each time the movement speed
increases by the base speed.

A character can always start to walk, run or sprint without a check, as long
as he doesn't try to go over the standard sprinting speed (see "6.3.3 Heavy
Sprinting") or does not suffer from heavy fatigue. If the game master judges
that a character is too tired to move, he can require a movement check before
the character starts to move (no fatigue is added to the Fatigue heap before
making this check). If the check passes, then the character moves normally. If
the check fails, then the game master can either impose a maximum speed for
the character or require that the character rests before starting to move. In
the later case, the character can attempt to move as soon as his Fatigue heap
has been reduced by one point or more.

Example:
A human runner wants to finish a marathon in about 2 hour and 10 minutes. To
cover the 42 km in 130 minutes, he needs to go at about 19 km/h, which is
approximately equal to 6 times the base speed of 3 km/h. He will thus have to
make a movement check every 4 minutes. (Note: running a marathon in 2h10min is
a world class performance.)

Our marathon runner has an Endurance skill of 30 (Training = 25, FIT = +5).
After 4 minutes of running, his Fatigue heap is increased by one and he has to 
make a first movement check:

d10-d10 + Endurance >= -5 + Fatigue
d10-d10 + 30        >= -5 + 1

It is quite obvious that he has virtually no chance of failing this check. In
fact, he is almost certain of being successful in the first 25 checks (unless
he rolls a fumble). This well trained runner can thus run at 19 km/h for 100
minutes (25 checks * 4 minutes/check) without any major problem. It only
starts getting difficult for him in the last 30 minutes, when he has to give
his last energies to maintain the same rhythm.

If a similar situation occurs in a game, it is strongly suggested that the
game master does not require the players to roll for checks that are always
successful unless the character fumbles. The players should not have to roll
as long as their skill is 10 points higher than the task difficulty. For our
marathon runner, this means that we need to roll only the last seven check.
The first of these check is:

d10-d10 + 30 >= -5 + 26

while the seventh is:

d10-d10 + 30 >= -5 + 32

If he makes these seven movement checks successfully, he will have completed
the marathon in 2 hours and 10 minutes!

6.4.3 Heavy Sprinting
---------------------

The sprinting speed given in the movement rates table is the speed that all
members of a species can sustain for a short period of time (1 minute). If
a characters wants to go faster than the standard sprinting speed, he faces
a greater difficulty than just having to make more frequent checks. For each
increment of speed equal to the base speed, 5 is added to the task difficulty.
Thus, to run 100 meters in 10 seconds, a character would need to go at 
60 meters/round, which means an increase of 20 of the task difficulty. In 
addition, the character needs to make a movement check every round.

The check that a human needs to make to run 100 meters in 10 seconds is:

d10-d10 + Talent + Training >= 15 + Fatigue

When a character wants to move at a speed greater than the standard sprinting
speed, he also needs to make an initial movement check. No fatigue is added
to the Fatigue heap before making this check (Fatigue is always added at the
end of the movement period). 

If a character tries to move faster than the sprinting speed but fails his
check, the maximum speed that he can reach is obtained by substracting Fatigue
from his total roll and comparing the result with the Movement TD in the table
below. The maximum speed that he can reach corresponds to the maximum movement
TD that is smaller than or equal to his adjusted roll. For example, if a
sprinter rolls a total 6 on his movement check and has a Fatigue of 3, then
his adjusted roll is 3 and he can reach a maximum speed of 9 times the base
speed (45 meters/round for a human).

The maximum speed that a character can reach is equal to 12 times the base 
speed. For a human, this speed is equal to 60 meters/round, which is equivalent
to running 100 meters in 10 seconds, a feat that only olympic athletes can
achieve. Of course, the game master is free to remove this limitation on
maximum speed.

----------------------------------
Speed                  Movement TD
----------------------------------
Sprinting or below              -5
9*Base                           0
10*Base                          5
11*Base                         10
Maximum                         15
----------------------------------

Example:
An olympic athlete with Sprinting skill of 25 (Training = 20, STR = +5) is on
the starting line for the 100 meters race. As he is fully rested, his Fatigue
is initially equal to 0. Upon hearing the gun, he jumps from the starting
blocks. An initial movement check is made:

d10-d10 + Sprinting Skill >= Movement Task Difficulty + Fatigue
d10-d10 + 25              >= -5 + 20                  + 0
-2      + 25              >= 15
23                        >  15           -> success

This initial movement check is successful and the character is thus moving at
60 meters per round. However, since his speed is equal to 12 times the base
rate, he must make a check every round. He will thus have to make another
check after one round (6 seconds) of running. His Fatigue heap is increased by
1 due to the first round of sprinting and his second movement check is:

d10-d10 + Sprinting Skill >= Movement Task Difficulty + Fatigue
d10-d10 + 25              >= -5 + 20                  + 1
3       + 25              >= 16
28                        >  16           -> success

This second check is also successful and the sprinter makes it to the finish
line in 10 seconds!

6.4.4 Movement Skills
---------------------

For movement slower than sprinting, players should use the "Endurance" skill
in the movement check, or Fitness if their character does not possess the
Endurance skill. For movement at or above the sprinting speed, players should
use the "Sprinting" skill or the Strength talent of their character in the
movement check.

If a character does not have a Training in either Running or Sprinting, he
does not face an Untrained penalty (UP=0). These skills are considered to be
common enough that everyone has a basic training in them.

-----------
6.5 Healing
-----------

Activity                   - Per day -       Weekly
level     Example     w/o Healer  w/healer*   bonus
---------------------------------------------------
Low       Bed rest       10%        20%       +2d6
Moderate  Travelling      5%        10%       +1d6
High      Fighting        0          1          0

* conditions apply (ref. Medicine skill)

Healing rates per day are based on a percentage of the injured person's BODY
Talent increased by 25. For example, a person with a BOD of -3 would heal
2 points of injury per day without healer (10% * (-3+25)).
   Activity level - means the most demanding level of activity undertaken
                    during any particular day or week.
   Weekly bonus - requires a successful Fitness roll vs Injury
                  (d10-d10 + 10 + FIT >= INJURY). If successful, INJURY is 
                  reduced by the indicated roll.

-----------
6.6 Falling
-----------

A character falling on hard ground suffers 1d6 points of damage for each
2 meters of his fall. This damage is not reduced by armor resistance.
 
------------------
6.7 Lifting Weight
------------------

The maximum weight that a character can lift easily is given by the LIFT value
from the Strength Table. When lifting weight, the following equation is used:

d10-d10 >= Lift TD [+ Fatigue]

--------------------------------------------------------
Action                         Lift TD    Fatigue Rating
--------------------------------------------------------
Lift just above ground          -15                  (8)
Lift at waist height            -10                  (9)
Lift at head height              -7                 (10)
Lift overhead                    -5                 (10)
--------------------------------------------------------

For every increase in weight equal to LOAD STEP, increase TD by 1
For every decrease in weight equal to LOAD STEP, decrease TD by 1
       
Shortcut Formula: TD = Lift TD + ( (Weight-LIFT) / LOAD STEP )
 
***************************************************************************
SECTION 7     COMBAT

----------------
7.1 Introduction
----------------

"... violence is the last refuge of the incompetent." Isaac Asimov

When other means of achieving objectives have failed, the party of adventuring
characters may find themselves in an encounter that leads to combat.   Combat
can take many forms including melee, archery, arcane, etc.  Good combat
rules should cover all those situations, while being simple enough not to
prevent the players from having fun.

Like everything else in the DragonNet system, combat rules seek to achieve a
balance between realism, simplicity and heroism.  In a completely realistic
system, serious wounds often prove fatal and the game master has to take great
care not to create a situation where combat is unavoidable.  At the opposite,
in a heroic system where the characters can endure extreme wounds without
flinching, combat often becomes the preferred mean to resolve situations of
conflict.  In our vision, combat should not limit character development by
ending it whenever it happens, nor should it prevent it by being a universal
solution to all problems.  Therefore, the DragonNet combat system is deadly
enough that characters won't always seek combat as the solution to their
problems, but not so deadly as to make the characters flee each time brute
force is required.

------------------
7.2 Basic Premises
------------------

7.2.1 The Combat Round
----------------------

As in many RPG system, combat in DNET is resolved by dividing its duration
into rounds.  During a round, each character can perform one action:
attacking
an opponent, casting a spell, reloading a bow, etc.  Each combat round
represents six seconds of action, giving ten rounds per minute.

During a combat round, each protagonist will get to accomplish one action,
without consideration for who acts first or last.  Each attack/defense
confrontation is in fact an exchange of blows and the damage inflicted by the
protagonists upon each other is the summation of the effects of each
individual blow.  It is therefore perfectly possible for two combatants to
finish off each other in the same round, giving a situation similar to the
final combat scene in the movie "Excalibur".

7.2.2 Combat Styles
-------------------

There is more to combat than just swinging a weapon; most of the reflexes that
make a good fighter have more to do with the way he uses his weapon than with
the particular weapon used.  The skills your character has to learn to be a
proficient fighter are thus named combat styles.  The primary style for a
fighter with military training would probably be "Weapon and Shield".  A
northern barbarian wielding a claymore would most often use the "Two-handed
weapon" style.  A magic oriented character would probably opt for a low cost
style such as "Staves", giving him basic combat abilities while letting him
focus most of his efforts on magic lore.

As your character gains experience, he can advance in one or more combat
style.  Since combat styles are used for both attack and defense, improving
them makes you both harder to hit and better at hitting your opponents.

7.2.3 Impact, Damage and Injury
-------------------------------

When you hit an opponent with a weapon, you generally intend to cause him some
physical damage.  The DragonNet system uses a specific procedure with its
associated terminology to calculate this damage; the basics of the damage
calculation procedure are exposed here, so that you can better understand
the rest of the system.  The complete procedure will be described in detail
later in the combat chapter.

Every physical attack is said to cause an IMPACT.  For example, a hit with
bastard sword made by an average human causes 2d6+4 points of IMPACT.  If the
target is wearing armor, part of the attack's IMPACT is absorbed by the armor,
while the remaining part, if any, constitutes the true physical DAMAGE, which
is added to the target's INJURY heap.  If the target suffers too much
INJURY, i.e. more than what is BODY allows, he will pass out and eventually
die.

7.2.4 Combat Round Sequence
---------------------------

Most gamers hate it when the mechanics of combat system take more time than
the actions and tactical decisions of the characters.  In other words, the
mechanics should not slow down the combat flow and bring down the climactic
tension.  The combat round sequence outlined here and described more fully
later in the text will generally be most effective one for smooth combat
resolution.

The combat round begins with the declaration phase, during which each player
announces the actions of his character(s) and the game master states the
actions of the non-player characters (NPC).  The order of the declaration
can be arbitrary or determined by rolling for initiative.  In both cases, it
is advantageous to declare last, since you can decide the actions of your
character in regard of what others have announced.

After all actions have been declared, the resolution phase begins.  No
particular order is required, as all actions are considered to be
simultaneous and every character is assured that he will have a chance to
attempt its planned actions.  For attacks, resolution is divided in two
steps: the attacker first attempts to hit the defender in a contest of
skills; if he is succesful, damage is calculated using the procedure outline
above (sec. 7.2.3).

At the end of each combat round, after all actions have been resolved,
characters that have been wounded during the round must check to see if they
remain conscious and alive.

-----------------
7.3 Combat Skills
-----------------

7.3.1 Combat Styles
-------------------

One of the fundamental premises behind the DNET combat system is that one's
fighting style is more important than the actual weapon used. A fighter used
to fighting with a broad sword and a shield will find it much easier to fight
with a bastard sword and a shield than to fight with a broad sword alone. His
combat reflexes are tuned to certain strike sequences relying on the shield
to parry blows. For him, fighting without the shield means developping new
strike sequences, something that is not always easy to do in the middle of
a melee.

Table Description
-----------------
EP Cost - This is the training cost associated with the skill
Attribute Tal - The attribute which forms the basis for using this skill.
                (i.e. The attribute acts as a modifier for use of the skill
                                in the targeting equation.)
Attribute Adv - This attribute is used as a modifier for advancement of
                the skill.
AM - Attack modifier
DM - Defense modifier

Special Characteristics
-----------------------

Range: Close (0 - 1 m; actually engaged in close combat)
       Near (1 - 10 m; engaged or able to move to engage this round)
       Far (11 - 100 m; not in melee range, but probably in missile weapon
                        range)
       Extreme (> 100 m; out of all but the longest range missile weapons)

2nd rank: extended weapon reach to attack opponents from a distance, as from
  behind a line of friendly shield bearers.

Fend: Basically Fend keeps opponent with shorter weapon at a distance unable
  to attack. Opponent who loses against Fend either cannot attack or takes
  automatic hit at full damage (maximum for thrusting weapon and STR bonus).

  A Fend can be started if an opponent is outside of Close range at the start
  of a combat round. Otherwise, a successful Fend means that an opponent who
  is at Close range is unable to attack in the next round. A successful Fend 
  must occur in each subsequent round to keep the opponent at bay.

Entangle: entangle limbs. A successful attack will entangle the limbs of the
  defender, unless an AGI check against a TD equal to the attacker's total
  roll is made by the defender. The attacker must specify that he is trying 
  to entangle during the declaration phase.

Trip: entangle legs and trip opponent. A successful attack will entangle the
  legs of the defender, unless an AGI check against a TD equal to the 
  attacker's total roll is made by the defender. The attacker must specify 
  that he is trying to trip during the declaration phase.

Shield bonus: +1 to +5 defense bonus depending on the type of shield

Shield bash: ability to use shield as a weapon. Blow causes 1d6 + 1 point per
  size category of the attacker + STR of attacker. Defender is knocked off
  his feet unless a successful AGI check against a TD equal to the attacker's 
  total roll is made.

DEF Fencing/Close only: Defense against Fencing and Close styles only.

7.4 Combat Sequence
-------------------

This section explains in detail how combat is resolved in the DragonNet 
system. To this end, a game situation leading to combat is developped as the 
rules are presented.

Combat is broken down into rounds.  Each round is considered to last 6
seconds. All actions that occur within a round are independent of each other
and are considered to take place at the same time.  Thus it is always possible
for two combatants to strike each other down in the same round.

Within a combat round, attacks and defenses are viewed as a passe d'armes, not
as individual strokes.

Game situation: Neila and Jalik have been cautiously exploring the ruins
  of a temple of Hekari, an almost forgotten deity of darkness and disease,
  in the hope of lifting a curse that as been plaguing a pixie community
  for centuries. As they are about to despair, their efforts are rewarded
  by a hollow sound from a flagstone reveals a hidden passage. After
  doublechecking their torches and pushing the stone safely aside, they
  engage in the the shadows of a stairway.

The characteristics and appropriate skills and equipment of the two characters
are given here for reference purposes.

Neila (Bob's character)
Physical Talents: AGI: 2; BOD: 2; DEX: -2; FIT: 1; STR: 3
Mental Talents:   AUR: 0; INT: 1; PER: 0;  PSY: 1; WIL: 2
Combat skills:
                          Ta + Tr = Skill
  One Handed W. & Shield: 2  + 6  = 8      Attack: 8  Defense: 8+2+4 = 14
  Dodge:                  2  + 7  = 9      Defense: 9+4 = 13
Equipment:
  War Hammer (IMPACT = 2d6+4)
  Kite (defense bonus = 4)
  Soft leather bezainted armor (RESISTANCE = 6)

Jalik (Roger's character)
Physical Talents: AGI: 3; BOD: 1; DEX: 2; FIT: 0; STR: 0
Mental Talents:   AUR: 1; INT: 1; PER: 2; PSY: 0; WIL: 0
Combat skills:
                Ta + Tr = Skill
  Dual Weapons: 3  + 6  = 9      Attack: 9+2 = 11  Defense: 9-1 = 8
  Dodge:        3  + 5  = 8
Equipment:
  2 small swords (IMPACT = 2d6+2)
  a 2 meters wooden pole
  Quilt armor (RESISTANCE = 3)
  
7.4.1 Declaration
-----------------

At the beginning of every combat round, the game master must ask every player
to declare the actions of his character for the round. The game master must
also state the actions of all NPCs and monsters during that phase. Once 
stated, these actions cannot be changed, unless the game master feels that
there has been a misunderstanding; in that case, every player should be 
allowed to redeclare the actions of his character.

The declaration order does not really matter as long as the actions of all 
protagonists are stated. A fixed order, such as *going around the table will
generally speed game play.

Note that a character can attack multiple targets only if he is in close range
(0 to 1 meters) of both targets at declaration time.

Game situation: Jalik and Neila reach the bottom of the stairs about 5 meters 
  below the ground level.
  Game master: In the torchlight, you can see that the floor is littered with
    bones.
  Roger: "[Whisper] Cover me." I slowly crouch to inspect the bones.
  Game master: They look like humanoid bones, generally human sized.
  Roger: I inspect the walls, looking for holes or any trace of a mechanism.
  Game master: You spend 5 minutes doing as careful an inspection you can
    without stepping on the floor. The walls are plain and smooth. You can
    detect any obvious crevasse.
  Roger: I slowly pass the wooden pole along the floor and the walls.
  Game master: (rolling a few dice to make good impression) Nothing happens.
  Bob: "[Whisper] It looks ok?"
  Roger: "[Whisper] Yes... I go first, you follow me 4 steps behind."
    I advance in the passage, tell me when I notice anything different.
  Game master: After 4 meters, the floor is clear of bones. The transition
    is gradual.
  Roger: I continue.
  Bob: I still follow about 2 meters behind.
  Game master: You walk two more steps and hear a concert of clicking sounds
    as the bone quickly move along the floor to reassemble into three distinct
    shapes. Two of the shapes are near Neila, while the third is behind 
    Jalik's back. What do you do?
  Bob: "[Loud] Watch your back!". Neila attacks the nearest shape and will 
    dodge the two others if necessary.
  Roger: Jalik drops his pole and takes out his two swords. He will also
    attack the nearest shape.
  Game master: Jalik's attack won't happen until next round, but they won't
    be able to attack this round either. Neila, you realize that you can 
    bash at the nearest one without worrying about dodging the other.

---- 7.4.1.1 Initiative (OPTIONAL) ----

Some role players find that basing the declaration order on the Talents of
their characters allow for more strategy during combat. A declaration method
which allow the characters with the best perception to react to the actions
of others is presented here. 

Determining initiative:
1) Roll 1d10
2) Add PER (you may get negative results)

INITIATIVE = 1d10 + PER

All players should roll for initiative and the game master should also roll
it for NPCs and monsters. In large combats, the game master may wish to roll
initiative for groups of monsters or even for all monsters at the same time.

Actions are then declared starting with the lowest initiative roll to the
highest. This gives a chance to characters with the highest PER to adjust
their actions to those of others.

[Should we add weapon speed and spell casting time here? It seems weird to 
me to add such a modifier before the action has been declared if the goal
of the initiative roll is of determining who will declare first so that
one can adjust himself to the actions of others. (Guillaume)]

7.4.2 Action resolution
-----------------------

Once all actions have been declared, they are resolved using standard skill
checks. The order of the resolution does not matter since all actions within
a round are considered to be simultaneous. Again, resolving the actions
in a fixed order will speed up the game and simplify combat.

While there are no strict limits to the actions that can be attempted during 
combat, we will focus here on the actions that are directly related to the 
resolution of combat.

---- 7.4.2.1 Targeting ----

The determination of an attack outcome is achieved using the targeting
equation:

d10-d10 + Att Sk [+ Sk mods] >= d10-d10 [+ TD mods] + Def Sk [+ Sk mods]

If the left hand side is greater than or equal to the right hand side, then 
the attacker scores a hit and should proceed to determine damage.

While this expression may seem complex, it summarizes a very simple process:

1) Both the attacker and the defender roll d10-d10, as in a skill check.
2) The attacker adds his Attack Skill to his roll, while the defender
   adds his Defense Skill to his roll.
3) They also add any situation combat modifiers that the game master judge
   necessary to their respective rolls.
4) If the attacker's total is greater than or equal to the defender's total,
   then the attacker is successful in his attack and should now roll for 
   DAMAGE.

The targeting roll can be modified by situation combat modifiers. These
situation combat modifiers are chosen by the game master and are broken into 
two categories:

   - Task Difficulty Modifiers (TD mods): modifiers that affect the 
     difficulty of the combat task.

   - Skill Modifiers (Sk mods): modifiers that affect the skill of the
     combatants.
     
Situation combat modifiers are detailed in sections 7.3.2.1.1 and 7.3.2.1.2.

OPTIONAL:
   For NPCs, the GM may replace the defender roll by a constant value of 0 
   to accelerate combat resolution:
   
   d10-d10 + Att Sk [+ Sk mods] >= 0 [+ TD mods] + Def Sk [+ Sk mods]   
          
   This increases the effects of a difference between the skill levels of
   the attacker and defender, i.e. the opponent with the skill will win
   more often than when both opponents roll for defense.
   
   Of course, the game master can decide that neither PCs, nor NPCs roll
   for defense.

Game situation:
  (first round) Neila swings her war hammer at the nearest skeleton.
  -> Bob rolls 3 and adds Neila's attack skill of 8 for a total of 11.
  -> The game master rolls -2, adds the skeleton guardian defense skill of
     8 and a skill modifier of -2 due to the fact that the guardian is still 
     taking shape, for a total of 4.
  Neila hits the skeleton and sends crushed bones flying. In the meantime,
  Jalik wields his two swords.

  (sixth round) Neila is still engaged with two Guardians; she has suffered
  a few hits but has nearly destroyed the first while dodging the other.
  Jalik has also hit is Guardian a few times, while taking only two hits.
  Neila's attack:
  -> Bob rolls 23 (!), adds Neila's attack skill of 8 and substracts 5
     because of the multiple actions (attacking and dodging) for a total
     of 26.
  -> Game master rolls -7 (!) and adds the skeleton defense skill (8) for
     a total of 1.
  ---> Neila scores another precise hit on the first skeleton.
  1st skeleton's attack:
  -> Game master's roll: -9 + 8 = -1
  -> Bob's roll: -2 + 14 - 5 = 7
  ---> Neila blocks the skeleton attempts.
  2nd skeleton's attack:
  -> Game master's roll: 3 + 8 = 11
  -> Bob's roll: -1 + 13 (dodge skill) - 5 = 8
  ---> The skeleton hits Neila.
  Jalik's attack:
  -> Roger's roll: 6 + 11 = 17
  -> Game master's roll: -1 + 8 = 7

---- 7.4.2.1.3 Called Shots ----

Targeting a specific body part is refered to as a called shot. While
targeting vital organs can increase the deadliness of an attack, those vital
organs are often small and thus more difficult to hit.

The table below gives Impact modifiers for some human body parts. These
modifiers are based on the probability of hitting a vital organ in the
targeted part. The effect of hitting non-vital organs is left to the game
master. For example, a serious blow to the hand might cripple its victim in
addition of doing normal Impact. Listing all such consequences is beyond the
scope of these rules.

-------------------------------
Impact Modifier     Body Part
-------------------------------
       +10          Head
       +15          Throat
       +20          Eye
-------------------------------

When making a called shot, the targeting roll of the character is modified
by the size rating of the body part targeted. This size rating (SR) can be
determined from the Size Rating table below. You can either estimate the
average dimension of the targeted part and look for a matching number in the
size column, or just scan the examples for a part of similar size.

Targeting equation for called shots:

d10-d10 + Attack Skill + SR >= Task Difficulty

Called shots are generally applied to missile weapons. In melee combat
battling an opponent larger than you does not make him much easier to hit
since he also benefits from an extended reach...

Most values listed are for human body parts. You can convert to the species
being targeted very simply, by adding the Size Rating of the species to the
Size Rating of the human body part.

Body Part SR = Human body part SR + species SR

Example:
SR of human arm  = -4
SR of weejon arm = SR of human arm + SR of Weejon
                  = -4 + -3
                  = -7

What happens if a player targets an opponent's eye or another body part and
miss by one on his attack roll? Since we don't want to get into overly
complicated and cumbersome mechanics, we leave this to the interpretation of
the game master. It could either be treated as a complete miss, a hit to a
nearby bone that only does normal Impact or a full hit to the head.
Situational modifiers that may influence this decision include the movement
speed of the opponent, the fact that he may be wearing a helmet, etc.

---- 7.4.2.2 Targeting with Missile Weapons ----

Missile weapon styles are handled as standard skills, with a TD that is 
mainly dependent on the distance between your character and its target. For
simplicity, the base task difficulty does not depend on the weapon used and
is given in the following table:

+---------------------+-------------------+---------+
| Distance qualifier  | Range             | Base TD |
+---------------------+-------------------+---------+
| Near                | 0 to 10 meters    |    0    |
| Medium              | 11 to 50 meters   |    5    |
| Far                 | 51 to 100 meters  |   10    |
| Very Far            | 101 to 500 meters |   15    |
+---------------------+-------------------+---------+

The targeting equation is:

  d10-d10 + Missile Weapon Skill >= Task Difficulty

Since all missile weapons are not equal in effectiveness, an effective range
is associated with each one. When the target is beyond a weapon's effective
range, additional penalties are applied to the task difficulty. The TD
increases by 1 for each 2 meters over the effective range of Thrown Weapons
and by 1 for each 5 meters beyond the effective range or bows and crossbows.
As usual, the game master can either apply this rule as a strict rule, as a
simple guideline or even completely dismiss it. Sometimes, it is simpler to
just consider all situational modifiers and make a quick decision on the TD.

+---------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Weapon Type         | TD modifier                         |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Thrown              | 1 per 2 meters over effective range |
| Bow                 | 1 per 5 meters over effective range |
| Cross Bow           | 1 per 5 meters over effective range |
+---------------------+-------------------------------------+

Missile weapons also have a maximum range beyond which they cannot send a
missile. This maximum range is normally listed in the weapons description.

Damage and called shots are handled in the same manner than for melee 
attacks.

Examples:
In the following examples, we use one weapon of each group: a dagger,
(effect. range: 15m; max. range:40m), a short bow (effect. range: 90m; max.
range: 225m) and a heavy arbalest (effect. range: 60m, max range: 330m).

Situation 1: Target is 8 meters away.
  TD is 0 with all three weapons, since the target is near and within their 
  effective range.

Situation 2: Target is 20 meters away.
  TD is 7 with the dagger since the target is in medium range (TD 5) and is
  5 meters over the dagger's effective range (we choose to round at the
  players advantage here...).
  TD is 5 with both the short bow and arbalest, since the target is within
  their effective range.

Situation 3: Target is 100 meters away.
  Such a dagger throw is "impossible" since the target is beyond the dagger's
  maximum range.
  TD is 12 with the short bow since the target is far (TD 10) and is
  10 meters over the bow's effective range.
  TD is 18 with the short bow since the target is far (TD 10) and is
  40 meters over the bow's effective range.

Situation 4: Target is 500 meters away.
  Don't even think about it...

OPTIONAL:

In some situations, it makes sense to take into account the size of the
target. In these cases, the task difficulty can be modified by substracting
from it the size rating (SR) of the target. For example, hitting a giant
(SR: 4) standing 20 meters away with with a short bow has a TD of 1, while
hitting a weejon (SR: -3) at the same distance has a TD of 8. As a
reference, humans have a Size Rating of 0. The game master is free to apply
this rule whenever he wishes.

Size Rating Adjustement: Adjusted TD = Standard TD - Size Rating

---- 7.4.2.3 Damage and Injury ----

When a successful hit has been scored, DAMAGE is computed by substracting
the defender's RESISTANCE from the attacker's IMPACT.

DAMAGE = IMPACT - RESISTANCE

The attacker's IMPACT is the sum of his Strength and his weapon's Impact:

IMPACT = Weapon IMPACT + STR

The RESISTANCE of the defender is the sum of his Natural Resistance and
his armor's Resistance:

RESISTANCE: Natural Resistance + Armor Resistance

Armor Resistance is always a positive value that depends on the type of
armor being worn.  Natural Resistance is a value representing the natural
body covering of a species (see the species description).  Natural Resistance
can be negative.  Because of this, RESISTANCE can be negative as well.

If DAMAGE is lower than 0, then it is considered to be 0. A DAMAGE of 0 or
less is considered to be just a scratch. If DAMAGE is greater than 0, then
it should be added to the INJURY heap.

INJURY = INJURY + DAMAGE

Game situation:
  (first round)
  To determine the IMPACT done by Neila's hit on the skeleton, Bob rolls
  11 on 2d6+4 (the war hammer Impact) and adds Neila's STR for a total of
  14. The game master substract the Natural Resistance (5) of the Guardian 
  from Neila's IMPACT and adds 9 to the Guardian's INJURY heap (previously
  at 0).

  (sixth round) (Note that DAMAGE calculations are normally done just
  after determining if an attack was successful. All DAMAGE calculations
  are presented here in the same section for explanation purposes)
  -> Neila hits the first skeleton for 11+3=14 points of IMPACT. This
     increases the skeleton's INJURY by 9 to a total of 36.
  -> The second skeleton hits Neila for 8+2=10 for a DAMAGE of 4 after
     the attack has passed through the armor (RESISTANCE=6). This
     brings her INJURY heap to 26.
  -> Jalik hits the third skeleton for 6 points of IMPACT. Only 1 point
     passes the skeleton's Natural Resistance, bringing its injury
     heap to 24.
  -> The third skeleton does 13 points of IMPACT to Jalik. His armor only
     absorbs 3 points, adding 10 points of DAMAGE to INJURY, for a total
     of 18.

---- 7.4.2.3.1 Precision (OPTIONAL) ----

This optional technique for computing damage has the advantage of reducing the
need to resort to called shots, but give the same IMPACT distribution to all
weapons.

When using Precision, IMPACT is not rolled but is computed from the targeting
roll. Each weapon has a constant IMPACT, which is equal to the average of its
normal IMPACT reduced by 4. For example, a bastard sword which has an IMPACT
of 2d6+4, with an average of 11, would have an IMPACT of 7 when using the
Precision rule.

Precision weapon IMPACT = Average normal weapon IMPACT - 4

When a hit occurs, the total IMPACT inflicted is equal to the sum of weapon
IMPACT and the value of the targeting roll that is over what was needed to
hit. For example, if the attacker has a total roll of 19 and the defender has
a total roll of 16, then the Precision IMPACT is 3 and the total IMPACT done
with a bastard sword is 10 (7 + 3). The total roll is the sum of the
character's skill, the situational modifiers and the rolled die.

If the attacker's roll is lower than the defender's roll, then no hit has
occured; precision does not change the targeting rules, only the manner in
which damage is calculated.

Note: When defense is rolled, precision can cause very high IMPACT values
  if the attacker has a high roll and the defender a very low roll. The
  game master should be warned that it can increase the death rate of
  characters, as a character can go from nearly unconscious to dead with
  one hit.

---- 7.4.2.4 Multiple Actions in Combat ----

The multiple actions mechanism is used frequently in combat. When a
character wants to defend against multiple opponents, he has to buy multiple
actions for a penalty of 5 on all his skills. Each additional combat style
action gives both one attack and one defense. For example, if a character
attacks and defends against two opponents, his two attacks and two defenses
are done with a -5 penalty. Similarly a character attacking one opponent and
dodging two others would have a -5 on his rolls in both his combat style
and dodge skill.

Actions that are not related to combat also impose a -5 penalty on all skill
checks when they are performed while the character fights. If a character
wants to catch an object while fighting, he would face a -5 penalty on both
his catching roll and his attack and defense.

Note that the defense skill of the character can never be lowered below 0 by
any penalty, since a defense of 0 is that of a moving target within range.
It is considered that your character cannot do worse if he tries to defend
than if he does not try to.

7.4.3 Survival checks
---------------------

At the end of the combat round, after all actions have been resolved, every 
combatant that has been injured during the round (i.e. that has seen his 
INJURY heap increase) must make Unconciousness and Death checks.

An Unconsciousness check is made by rolling d10-d10 and adding 25 plus the
character's Willpower and BODY. If the total is greater than or equal to
INJURY, then the check is successful and the character stays conscious.

Unconsciousness: d10-d10 + 25 + BOD + WIL >= INJURY

It is not necessary to make an Unconsciousness check if 25 + BODY + WIL is
over INJURY by 10 points or more.

A Death check is similarly made by rolling d10-d10 and adding 40 and the
character's BOD. If the total is greater than or equal to the INJURY, then
the check is successful and the character stays alive.

Death:           d10-d10 + 40 + BOD >= INJURY

It is not necessary to make an Unconsciousness check if 40 + BOD is
greater than INJURY by 10 points or more.

OPTIONAL: If the Graded Outcomes rules are used, a partial outcome indicates
  that the character is not Unconscious but suffers from such pain that he
  is not able to do anything beside moaning and screaming. He remains
  generally aware of what is happening around him.

Game situation:
  (first round) The INJURY heap of the first Skeleton Guardian is now equal 
  to 9. Since this is much lower than 40 plus the BOD of the skeleton,
  there is no need for a Death check (the skeleton does not check for
  Unconsciousness, see description).

  (sixth round)
  -> Bob's roll for Neila: -3 + 25 + 2 (WIL) + 2 (BODY) = 26 (INJURY)
     Neila remains conscious enough to continue the fight. 
  -> Roger's roll for Jalik: -2 + 25 + 0 (WIL) + 1 (BODY) > 18 (INJURY)
     Jalik remains conscious.
  -> Game master's roll for the 1st skeleton:
     -6 + 40 + 0 (BOD) < 36 (INJURY)
     The skeleton crumbles into a heap of broken bones.
  -> The INJURY of the third skeleton (24) is much lower than his 
     BODY + 40 (0), so there is no need for a death check.

7.5 Unarmed Combat
------------------

7.5.1 Unarmed Attacks
---------------------

There are five types of unarmed attacks.  For game mechanics, they are
handled the same way as weapons are handled in armed combat styles.
They have an associated damage, reach, etc, just as weapons do.
An unarmed defender against a weapon gets no defence or a penalty, depending
on the fighting style being used.

+-----------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+
+ NAME            | ACTION | IMPACT | REACH | MASS  | LENGTH | HANDS | SPEED |
+-----------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+

|                 |        |        |       |       |        |       |       |

+-----------------+--------+--------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+

7.5.2 Unarmed weapon types
--------------------------

Attacks with hands or fists do 2d6-8 IMPACT, 2d6-6 if using brass knuckles.

Kicking attacks to 2d6-6 IMPACT.  

Bashing attacks include body slams and tackles.  
IMPACT is 2d6-4.  A running start is required to do damage, 
so no IMPACT is done if you are already at close range.  
(possible to force backwards even if starting at close range)

Throws include leg sweeps and judo/wrestling throws.  IMPACT is 2d6-6 and
is not modified by STR.  Success leaves the defender prone.

Hold attacks include judo holds and wrestling pins.  
After a successful attack the defender must make a roll if he wants to
try to break the hold.  
      d10-d10 + STR + skill >= holder's STR + skill
The "skill" may be from any style which includes "hold" attacks.
If the hold is successful, the attacker may choose to inflict damage: 
IMPACT is 2d6-4 (+STR).

* Note about HANDS: There are holds and throws which require two hands,
and some which require no hands.  The GM may judge if a maneuver is possible
or more difficult (skill penalty) in some situations, such as if the
player has his hands bound.

7.5.3 Unarmed Combat Styles
---------------------------

I would like to use a minimal list of unarmed combat styles, since it is
more in the spirit of the current weapon styles. A well rounded martial
artist using this list would learn Karate for the hand and foot maneuvers,
Close Weapons for the usual list of Chinese peasant weapons, Judo for
the throws, Staff, and One-Handed Weapon skills.

7.6 Movement and Distances in Combat
------------------------------------

7.6.1 Combat Movement
---------------------

While it may be possible for some characters to cover 60 meters in a standard
6 seconds round, this is not a typical character nor a character loaded with
equipment. Even if he was, he would be in no condition at the end of the round
to carry out other actions. Moreover this speed allows for only the gentlest
of turns; Combat movement involves turns and other actions.

The maximum speed that a character can move at in melee and still be able to
perform other actions without penalty is the base movement speed (see the
movement rules in section 6.3). For example, a human character might move up
to 5 meters during a round and attack without penalty.

If a character wants to move faster than the base movement speed in melee
combat, the game master can require him to make an AGI check against a TD
ranging from 0 to 5. A character can always move at the base movement speed
without a check (as long as he is not crippled).

When moving in a combat situation, a character must increase his Fatigue heap
at least every 5 rounds (30 seconds). He may have to increase his Fatigue more
often if he manages to move very fast (above the sprinting speed).

7.6.2 Attack reach (OPTIONAL)
------------------

7.6.3 Combat Hex Grid (OPTIONAL)
---------------------

---------------------
7.7 Fatigue in Combat
---------------------

In combat, be it melee or missile combat, the Fatigue heap must be increased
every 5 rounds (30 seconds), no matter what actions are performed (fighting,
moving, dodging, tending a wounded comrade, ...). As usual, Fatigue is
increased by 1 plus the Encumbrance Penalty.

If a character does not perform any action (he just stands there), then his
Fatigue does not increase.

SECTION 8     MAGIC

----------------
8.1 Introduction
----------------


------------
8.2 Overview
------------

Like every other aspect of DragonNet, the magic system is essentially made up
of skills and tasks which use those skills. In the specific case of the magic
system, the skills are those which give a character the capability to cast a
magical spell, and the tasks are: first, the use of source skills to access
the power for the spell, and second, the use of conductor skills to actually
cast the spell. For example, to cast the "Fireball" spell involves two
tasks, the first of which requires the application of the "Power of Energy"
skill and the second of which requires the application of the "Fire Focus"
skill.

Magic often varies from gameworld to gameworld, but the mechanics of how magic
works are still the same. In here we will use examples of how magic works of
the type of magic found in Corellus. The guidelines presented for created
types of magic and spells are just that: guidelines.

8.3 Magic Skills
----------------

There are two categories of magic skills in the DragonNet system. These are
source skills and conductor skills. For a character to successfully cast a
spell, he or she must successfully use source skills to make magical power
available, and then conductor skills to use that power. For example, a
magus' "Fireball" spell requires the caster to use the "Elemental Power of
Energy" source skill and then the "Elemental Fire Focus" conductor skill.
Thus, the character must succeed on two task resolutions: the first to
gather the necessary magical energy (source), and the second to use the
energy made available (conductor).

8.3.1 Sources
-------------

Source skills represent the ability of the caster to draw upon a particular
source of supernatural energy and make that energy available for the casting
of a spell. Sources are much like outlets in the modern world. Outlets are
useless by themselves, but when their energy is used by an appliance,
technological wonders occur. So, too, are source skills useless by themselves,
but when their energy is used by a conductor skill, magic happens.

Whenever a caster wishes to cast a spell, he must make the energy for that
spell available by using one or more source skills. Making the energy
available is a simple matter of making a  task check using the source skill
required of the spell at the Source Task Difficulty (TD) of the spell. For
example, the "Fireball" spell has a Source TD of 13 and to use that spell
the caster must first make the Source task check:

   d10-d10 + "Elemental Power of Energy" Skill >= 13

If the task check fails, the caster is unable to gather the energy required
for the spell and the spell fizzles. If the composite task check succeeds,
the character has successfully gathered the energy, and may proceed to
harness that energy using the appropriate conductor skill.

8.3.2 Conductors
----------------

Where source skills represent an ability to draw upon a particular source of
supernatural energy, conductor skills represent an ability to use that energy
in a particular way. Where a source skill is an outlet in the modern world, a
conductor is an appliance. Without electricity, appliances are useless by
themselves, but when they are given energy to work with they can do amazing
things. So, too, are conductor skill useless without energy from a source
skill, but when they have that energy, magic happens.

We must also take the analogy one step further. Not all appliances can plug
into all outlets throughout the world; they must have compatible voltages and
have the same type of current. Conductors, too, can only be used with those
sources with which they are compatible. Energy from any other incompatible
source is useless to them. The sources with which a given conductor is
compatible are listed in the description for that skill.

Once a caster has gathered the energy from a source, he or she can utilize
that energy by using a conductor skill. Similar to using source skills,
harnessing and shaping energy using conductor skills is a simple matter of
making a task check using the conductor skill required of the spell at the
Conductor Task Difficulty (TD) of the spell. For example, the "Fireball"
spell from above has a Conductor TD of 5 which uses the "Elemental Fire
Focus" conductor. Therefore, to finish casting this spell (once energy has
been made available from the appropriate source), the caster must make this
task check:

     d10-d10 + "Elemental Fire Focus" Skill >= 5

If the composite task check fails, the caster was unable to successfully
conduct the spell's energy and an unpredictable result may occur; the power
was not properly "focused." Once the conductor task check has succeeded, the
spell is cast.

Optionally, a failure of the source check can cause damage to the caster.

                              Table 8.3.4.1

Celestial Power of Darkness
    The Celestial Power of Darkness is one of the two Celestial Powers, those
    source skills used by Celestial Magi. This particular source allows a
    magus to call upon 'negative' magical energy to use with the Celestial
    Foci, those conductor skills compatible with the Celestial Powers and used
    by Celestial Magi. Darkness, when used with a Celestial Focus, destroys or
    diminishes that which falls under the purview of that Focus. The Power of
    Darkness is not an evil power, as many seem to believe, it is simply one
    of the destructive powers of the universe.

Celestial Power of Daylight
    The Celestial Power of Daylight is the 'positive' Celestial Power. It is
    used to build up and enhance in ways depending upon which aspect of the
    power the magus chooses to focus into form and reality.

Elemental Power of Energy
    The Power of Energy plays the role for Elemental Magi that the Power of
    Daylight plays for Celestial Magi. This power creates, enhances, and
    builds up the elements.

Elemental Power of Entropy
    The Power of Entropy is the opposite of the Power of Energy. Its role is
    similar to that of the Power of Darkness of the Celestial Magi. It tears
    down, destroys, and subdues the elements under its control. It is the
    unrelenting force in the universe that will not rest until all is
    destroyed. Again, this Power is not evil inherently, only when used for
    evil deeds.

Kundalini
    Kundalini is the raw energy which exists in the Astral Plane. The Psionic
    draws upon Kundalini and uses it through different Chakras (the associated
    conductors) to achieve different effects. The Psionic is more versatile
    than the Magi, but less powerful at manipulating his reality. None surpass
    the Psionic's mastery of the mind, however.

Spirit of [spirit]
    The Spirit world is the domain of the Shamanic spell-caster. For each type
    of Spirit the Shaman wishes to contact and commune with, the Shaman must
    have a Source skill. After the Spirit has been contacted using this Source
    skill, the Shaman must commune with the Spirit using the Communion
    conductor skill to attempt to explain to the Spirit what is desired, and
    to convince the Spirit to do as it is asked.

Doctrine of [deity]
    The power of the gods is available to those who call themselves Priests.
    Priests worship one (or, rarely, more) deity who answers his Priests'
    prayers and requests in the form of Miracles (spells). In order to have
    one's prayers heard by a deity, the Priest must have a skill in that
    deity's Doctrine. This skill represents how well the Priest knows the
    teachings and requirements of the deity necessary to get part of the
    deity's attention. The higher the character's skill in Doctrine, the
    greater portion of the deity's attention is gained. Once the Priest has
    successfully contacted the deity with a Doctrine skill, he must pray the
    the deity does as he wishes, the success of which is determined by the
    Priest's Piety skill to that deity.

*All Conductors have an UP of Impossible.

                              Table 8.3.3.2

Elemental Earth Focus
    The earth is the focus of physical power. This aspect of energy affects all
    things with solid physical form. With this power the magus may raise up
    great mountains, or bring them crashing down upon his foes. The earth
    aspect of entropy allows the magus to destroy the physical. With it he can
    disintegrate physical objects and beings, or create doorways where none
    were before.

Elemental Fire Focus
    Fire is the form of true power. Fire is heat, warmth, life, and energy. By
    mastering the aspect of fire, a magus can hurl balls of flame towards his
    enemies, or keep warm on a cold winters night. He can cause forest-fires
    in the dead of winter, or light a dark passage. Using entropy, the magus
    can hurl balls of ice, or stamp out natural or magical flames, or even put
    out the fire within each person.

Elemental Air Focus
    The focus of air is the ethereal aspect of the elemental powers. It
    controls winds and gravity. With the energy of air, a magus can fly above
    his enemies, or blow thunderstorms over their heads. The entropy of air
    can cause suffocation of his enemies, or bring things down to earth.

Elemental Water Focus
    The water focus is the domain of the seas and the lakes. It has complete
    control over liquids in all its forms. It can bring water into being for
    the benefit of the magus, or drown the magus' enemies. It can also create
    patches of ice, or slippery stones. The entropy aspect of this focus
    destroys water, soaks it up. This aspect can turn an enemy into parched
    dry bones instantly, or dry up a lake which happens to be in the way.

The 5th Elemental Focus
    Powerful Elemental Magi have theorized the existence of a 5th Element of
    unknown properties which could be used with the Energy or Entropy sources
    of Elemental magic. Unfortunately, no one has yet discovered this elusive
    Element, or determined its probable nature. Perhaps the sages of DnExotica
    will, in time, solve this perplexing mystery :). Current theories include
    the concept of an Element of Nothingness, or Void, an Element of Pure
    Magic, an Element of Spirit, an Element of the Aether, that which fills
    the Void, or a Quintessential Element. It is believed that once the 5th
    Element is discovered, many of the mysteries of Elemental magic will be
    solved.

Celestial Aurora Focus
    The aurora, which appears in the northern night sky, is the most beautiful
    and entrancing of all celestial elements. Through the study of this
    wondrous effect, magi are able to draw upon and use its ability to charm
    and entrance the observer. With this focus, the magus may charm an enemy
    and calm his friends. With the darkness of the aurora, a magus may strike
    fear into his enemy, remove charmed influences from his friends, and
    prevent beguiling effects from manipulating himself or others.

Celestial Comet Focus
    The comet is the messenger of the heavens. Continually moving at blinding
    speeds throughout the night sky, it is the master of all movement. By
    studying the properties of the comet, the magus is able to use its
    movement for himself. With this focus he can instantly move anywhere in
    the world, or, in combination with the focus of the firmament, he can even
    move out of this world. The darkness of the comet prevents movement,
    imprisoning and trapping enemies, and preventing others from coming near.

Celestial Firmament Focus
    The light of the sky and the heavens above is the study of the firmament.
    Those magi who strive to understand the magnitude of the firmament, are
    able to transcend this reality and get a glimpse into other realities of
    infinite varieties. Through this study, magi can commune with gods or
    angels or demons. In combination with the field of comet, magi are even
    able to walk the infinite planes of existence. Through the study of the
    night sky, the darkness of the heavens, magi are able to block off the
    conduits through which these inter-planar communion occur. With this
    discipline, magi can return foreigners to their home realities, and
    prevent their return, or stop the communication of other magi with
    extra-planar beings.

Celestial Light Focus
    Light is purity incarnate. This focus allows the magus to wield true power,
    without manipulation. With it bolts of pure magical energy can spring
    forth from the casters hand, or magical effects can be detected or
    enhanced. The dark allows the magus to cancel the magic of others or
    inhibit magic.

Celestial Moon Focus
    The moon is the mistress of mysteries, the lady of the night. Under her
    pale glow, reality takes on new dimension. By studying the moon, magi are
    able to use her light to mask reality, to make what isn't really there
    come to life. With this power, magi can weave strange and powerful
    illusions of things which only exist by the light of the moon, though the
    moon does not need to actually be shining for the magus to draw upon her
    power. Those who study the dark side of the moon, on the other hand, can
    see through all pretenses and appearances to the stark reality underneath,
    though the vision is not always a pleasant one. Illusions have no affect
    on those who wield the power of the dark side of the moon, and all that
    was once hidden comes clear.

Celestial Stars Focus
    The stars in their infinite formations hold the knowledge of all that was,
    all that is, and all that will be. Through the study of starlight, the
    magus can glean some small inkling into the vastness of the universe and
    can divine what is and what will come. Through knowledge of the light of
    the stars, all knowledge comes clear. However, by manipulating the dark
    stars, magi are able to obscure the meaning the stars hold. They can
    prevent less powerful magi from discerning particular knowledge, or even
    misdirect such inquiries.

Celestial Sun Focus
    The sun is the giver of life, the celestial orb that brings warmth and
    health to all the realms. Therefore, the sun is the focus of life. The
    celestial magus who masters the sun aspect of daylight masters life
    itself. He is capable of healing, or even of bringing those which were
    dead back to the realms of the living. However, the one who masters the
    darkness aspect of the sun learn the true meaning of death, and with that
    knowledge can bring death to others and undo the work of the sun.

Astral Chakra
    This is the Chakra that allows the Psionic that in addition to the normal
    capabilities of drawing power from the Astral Dimension, allows the
    Psionic to also travel into this dimension and to summon creatures from
    the Astral dimension.

Body Chakra
    Man is not made of only a mind, but also a physical body. Through the use
    of this Chakra, the Psionic can utilize the Astral energy to enhance his
    physical attributes.

Dream Chakra
    This powerful Chakra allows the Psionic to achieve superhuman feats, as he
    accomplishes them not in this world, but the world of his dreams. Of
    course, the unnaturally good is tempered with the unnaturally bad--most
    Dream powers carry some penalty, as they are under control of the Psionic
    subconscious, and not his conscious mind.

Emotion Chakra
    This Chakra deals with the emotional, colorful side of the mind, whereas
    Mind deals with the cold, logical side of the mind.

ESP Chakra
    Clairvoyance, reading the future, picking up auras would be included in
    this Chakra. It would also affect how much the psionic can perceive while
    in the astral plane.

Mind Chakra
    The Psionic's most powerful tool is his mind. Utilizing the Chakras of mind
    allows the Psionic not only to delve deeper into his mind than he normally
    would be capable of doing, but it also allows him to delve into the mind
    of others when it is used in conjunction with other Chakras.

Reality Chakra
    This Chakra is about imposing a Psionic's will over reality. Control over
    Fire, Air, Water, and Earth would be included in this Chakra. A psionic
    wouldn't be able to manipulate these elements as well as an elemental
    magus. An example of this Chakra would be a fire-starter (pyrogenic).

Temporal Chakra
    This Chakra would be allow the psionic to affect the flow of time and to
    perceive in things in the future and/or past. Examples of this would be
    (in conjunction with other Chakras) slowing down metabolism, fortune
    telling, speeding healing, etc.

Piety to [deity]
    The Piety skills represent how devout and reverent a character has learned
    to act towards a particular deity. Because the nature of worship required
    by separate deities is different, there is a unique Piety skill for each
    deity. Pragmatically, the Piety skills are what keep Priests on the 'good'
    sides of their deities. That is to say, the Piety skill helps to convince
    the deity to act in the best interests of the Priest, after the Priest has
    gotten part of the deity's attention, instead of, say, killing the priest
    :)

    Because the Priest must be able to gain a part of the deity's attention
    before making his request, the Priest must first have at least 1 level of
    training in the Doctrine skill of a deity before he may be trained in the
    Piety skill of that deity.

Communion with Spirits
    The Communion conductor is what allows those who weave Shamanic spells to
    commune with the denizens of the Spirit world. It is this communion which
    allows the caster to communicate to the Spirits his or her desires.
    Without this, the Spirits would be powerless to help the caster. The skill
    level a caster possesses in the Communion skill represents how capable the
    caster is of communicating complex wishes to Spirits.

    Before using the Communion skill, the caster must first contact the Spirit
    with which he wishes to commune using the appropriate Spirit skill, and he
    must, therefore, have some skill in a Spirit skill before gaining training
    in the Communion skill.

----------------------------
8.4 Fatigue and Casting Time
----------------------------

Casting spells is neither instantaneous, nor easy. While some very simple
spells can be cast in one or two seconds and with little effort, most spells
take at least a full round to cast and leave the magic user fatigued.

When casting a spell, the magic user has to channel the magical energy,
which is a very demanding activity for the magus body. The fatigue created
by the spell is thus proportional to the amount of energy tapped, i.e. to
the Source Task Difficulty. The Fatigue heap of the magus is increased by
one plus one fifth of the Source TD, rounding up, after the spell has been
completed. If the spell fails, the magus suffers from only half the normal
Fatigue associated with the spell. This Fatigue affects all subsequent
actions, including other spells cast by the magus.

While tapping a Source of magical energy takes time, it is a fast process
which does not impact much on the casting time of the spell. Harnessing and
shaping that energy into a useful spells takes more time and the casting
time of a spell therefore depends on the Conductor TD. The casting time of a
spell is equal to 5 plus the Conductor TD in seconds. The spell goes off in
the round during which its casting ends. For example, the "Fireball" spell
has a Conductor TD of 5 and thus takes 10 seconds to cast, going off in the
round after the casting has begun. A spell with a casting time of 18
seconds would go off in the third round of the casting. In the DNET system,
each round lasts 6 seconds, so that there are 10 rounds per minute.

OPTIONAL: If Fatigue is not used with the rest of the rules, the game master 
  may wish to simplify its application for the magi. One option is to
  increment Fatigue normally when casting a spell, but not to apply it as
  a penalty to subsequent actions. As a limiting factor to spell casting,
  the magi are only able to cast spells for which their Source skill is 
  greater than their Fatigue heap. For example, if a magician has a skill
  of 15 in the "Elemental Power of Energy", he could only cast the Fireball
  spell has long as his Fatigue heap remains below 15.

--------------------------
8.5 Magic Types Guidelines
--------------------------

Magic can come in many types and flavors. The GM will probably decide on the
types of magic depending on the type of world that is being played in. The
magic types in the standard world 'Corellus' provide good examples of how to
set up the types of magic.

The first thing that needs to be decided is what types of magical energy are
available for use. These are the sources that the players can use. Are there
any restrictions on these sources (e.g., priestly sources have the
restriction that the priest must be in good favor with that deity). Sources
have a base EP cost associated with them that reflects how hard it is to
draw on that source.

The next decision is, how can these sources be manipulated. These will be the
conductors. The conductors also usually have a base cost associated with them.
Other modifiers can be used from the table above.

The game master can also decide that each form of magic is associated with a
different vision of the world and that a single individual cannot embrace
more than one. For example, a magician specialized in the Elemental theory
would not be able to perform any Celestial spell, and might also have some
difficulty with Psionics. Once again, this kind of limitations are very world
specific.

A template for magic types can be found in section 9.5.

----------------
8.6 Magic Spells
----------------

The casting of magic spells is the primary task to which source and conductor
skills are put. The variety in types of spells is as infinite as a player's
imagination. Spell effects may be small or large, blatant or subtle. Types of
spells range from powers of the mind to pyrotechnics of the skies. Yet even
with all of these differences, there are some basic rules and guidelines
governing the creation and use of spells in the DragonNet system.


8.6.1 Casting Spells
--------------------

Casting a spell operates just like any other task in the DragonNet system with
two minor exceptions:

  1.)  Successful spellcasting requires two consecutive, successful 
       task checks: the first to make the energy available to the caster,
       using source skill(s), and the second to harness that available energy
       using conductor skill(s). No conductor check is needed if the source
       check is failed
  
  2.)  Secondly, spellcasting is much more tiring work than most activities. 
       To reflect this, the caster's fatigue heap is incremented by one plus 
       one fifth of the Source TD the spell the caster attempts to cast. If 
       the spell fails, the caster only suffers from half the normal Fatigue 
       increase.

Other differences may occur beyond those mentioned above, depending on the
spellcaster(s), the spell(s), and the skill(s) involved. For example, some
conductor skills require spells to be researched or otherwise learned before
they can be used.

In the standard rules, no spell requires any spell component, obvious
incantation or specific gesture. It is not meant that such requirement are
inappropriate, only that their application is left to the game master. Some
optional rules that integrate those elements may be included with the
standard rules in the future.

8.6.2 Spell Attributes
----------------------

All spells have many of the same basic attributes. These attributes bear no
relation to a character's attributes, except in that they serve to define the
basic nature of the spell in the same way that character attributes serve to
define the basic nature of a character. The basic attributes and their values
are:

Source(s)
    Each spell must also define which source(s) of energy are used to draw the
    power required by the spell.

Source TD
    The total TD associated with gathering the energy from the source(s).

Conductor(s)
    Each spell must also define which conductor(s) must be used to harness the
    energy once it is gathered from the source(s).

Conductor TD
   The total TD associated with making use of the conductors.

Fatigue
    The Fatigue created by the spell.
    
Casting Time
    This value represents the amount of time it takes to successfully cast the
    spell. This value is the Conductor TD of the spell, in seconds.

Duration
    This value represents the length of time the spell lasts once it has been
    successfully cast.

Range
    This value represents the maximum distance, in meters, from the caster that
    the spell effect may be centered or initiated.

Volume of Effect
    This value represents the volume of space which is directly affected by the
    casting of this spell. (Note that secondary effects, like falling rocks,
    may extend beyond this range.)

Spell descriptions may augment or supersede this list of attributes.

--- 8.6.2.1 Sample Spell ---

Fireball
--------
Source: Elemental Power of Energy
Conductor: Elemental Fire Focus
Source TD: 13
Conductor TD: 5
Fatigue: 4
Casting time: 2 rounds (10 seconds)
Duration: 1 round
Range: 40 meters
Volume of Effect. A sphere with a radius of 5 meters

Allows the mage to create a ball of fire of 10m radius at up to 40m from the
caster. Any person within the ball must make an AGI roll against a TD of 5
to receive only half damage. The fire causes 2d6+1 of damage to anyone who
misses the resistance roll. The center of the fireball is located at most 1
meter from the area determined by the mage.

8.6.3 Making Spells
-------------------

The procedure and rules used for making a new spell are entirely dependent
upon the types of conductor skills to be used by the Spell. Some conductors
require research and memorization, some require learning, others allow for
'on-the-fly' creation. Please see the conductor skill lists for specific
rules.

Standard spell creation rules have been designed for use with the magic
rules presented in this chapter. They  mainly consist in a set of standard
tables designed to calculate the Source and Conductor Task Difficulties. All
spells provided with the DNET system have been created using those tables
and all spells submitted will see their Source and Conductor TD evaluated
using them. You are free to ignore them completely if you find them too
cumbersome.

8.6.4 Tweaking Spells (VERY OPTIONAL)
-------------------------------------

Note: All the material presented in this section is optional.

The ability to tweak a spell allows a spellcaster to modify one or more of
the basic attributes of a spell, or (depending on the spell) some of the
specific effects of the spell (for example, putting more energy into a
simple "Fireball" spell can increase the damage it does, which is not a
basic attribute). For those spellcasters restricted to previously learned or
researched spells, the ability to tweak those spells they already know is a
godsend. However, the degree to which spells may be tweaked is limited, as
are the ways in which they may be tweaked.

When a caster tweaks a spell, he changes an aspect of the spell result by
changing either the Source TD, Conductor TD or both. Which aspects of a
spell may be tweaked, and to what degree at what cost, are generally
specific to the spell being cast. However, there are two general 'tweaks'
which should be available to almost all casters and for almost all spells:

  1.)  The fatigue caused by a spell may be reduced by using more finesse. 
       For every point by which the Source TD is decreased, the Conductor 
       TD is increased by 2. Fatigue and casting time are adjusted to 
       reflect the changes.
  
  2.)  The casting time of a spell may be reduced by using more brute force.
       For every point by which the Conductor TD is decreased, the Source 
       TD is increased by 2. Fatigue and casting time are adjusted to 
       reflect the changes.

Almost all other 'tweaks' change the Source or Conductor TD (and
subsequently both the casting time and the fatigue incurred) of the spell.
Examples of aspects of a spell which might be capable of being tweaked in
this way include:

   * Duration
   * Range
   * Volume of Effect
   * Damage

If the game master is very familiar with the magic system, he can guess the
variations in Source and Conductor TD on the fly when a mage attempts to
tweak a spell. Otherwise, it is suggested to use the spell creation tables
from the standard spell creation system.

8.7 General Principles of Magic
-------------------------------

[ This section is under construction ]

* spell effects repeat for the whole duration and are reapplied once per round.
* permanent creation or destruction is very difficult if not impossible.
* spells cannot be initiated outside their range
* spell effects disappear after the duration has expired. Exception: movement
  or shaping spells.

Using experience dice
---------------------
Once the experience dice have been awarded by the Game Master, the player
has three options:

1.)  He can roll the dice and get a number of experience points equal to their
      total.
2.)  He can play safe and get a number of experience points equal to 4 times 
      the number of experience dice (1 dice = 4 EP).
3.)  He can divide his experience dice between the two options above, 
      choosing to roll some of them and to cash in the remaining ones. The 
      player must decide how many dice will be rolled before he starts
      rolling.

Of course, the Game Master may rule that some options are not available if he
feels that they are detrimental to the game.

Example
-------
Say a player is awarded 10 experience dice. The player could:

1.)  Roll all 10 dice, which would generate from 10 to 60 points, with an 
     average of 35.
2.)  Exchange the 10 dice for 40 experience points.
3.)  Roll 3 dice and cash in the remaining 7, which would generate between
      31 and 46, with an average of 38.5.

------------------------------
9.2 Experience Dice During Play (Optional)
------------------------------
During a game session, if a character has some experience dice saved up,
he may use them for purposes other than skill advancement.

In this case, Experience Dice can be used for:

1. Improving a Task Resolution (d10-d10) roll
2. Increasing an Impact roll

To avoid a penalty, a player must declare the use of experience dice 
BEFORE he makes his roll. He should tell the GM that he wishes to 
modify his pending dice roll with some experience dice. After the GM has 
been told how many experience dice are going to be used in this way, the 
player rolls the total of the original dice plus how ever many experience 
dice he told the GM he was going to use.

If a player wishes to modify a die roll AFTER he has rolled the dice, he
must do so at a penalty of three times the cost; therefore, the player pays
three experience dice for each die added to the roll.

==============================
9.3 Affliction
==============================

Affliction is the general term given to any condition which will affect a
character adversly, such as poison and disease. The mechanics for determining
the results of disease or poisoning are the same.


9.3.1 Mechanics
-----------------

All poisons and deisease have a VIRULENCE rateing. In basic terms, the
VIRULENCE is a measure of the strength of the poison or disease; the
difficulty a person has in overcoming it's effects.

There are two stages of affliction: Partial Effects and Full Effects. The
effect on a creature will vary from affliction to affliction. Some example
afflictions will be given below.

A character will suffer partial effects from the affliction if they fail to
make their Afflicted roll, and likewise, they will suffer the full
effects if they fail to make their Resistance roll, as given below:

Afflicted:       d10-d10 + WIL + BODY >= VIRULENCE
Resistance:      d10-d10 + FIT + BODY + 5 >= VIRULENCE

Each affliction will also be given an Onset Time. It is after the Onset Time
has passed that a character is allowed to make their Afflicted roll.

Should a character succeed in making their Afflicted roll, they will suffer no
adverse effects from the affliction. Should the Afflicted roll be failed, and
after the Onset Time has passed again, the character is allowed to make their
Resistance roll. If the character makes their Resistance roll, the affliction
will proceed no further and the character will recover in 
(VIRULENCE - WILL - FIT) days.

If the Resistance roll is failed, the character will suffer, in addition to
the partial effects, the full effects of the affliction, and, if they survive,
will recover in (VIRULENCE - FIT) days.


9.3.2 Dosage
------------

Doseage for all afflictions is given as `LD50 doseage'. The LD50 doseage is
defined as the dosage that will cause death in 50% of the creatures exposed to
that doseage. The LD50 doseage is given or must be determined for each poison
or disease.

For the administration of either larger or smaller doseages, the following
table is used to determine VIRULENCE:

Dose       TD
---------------
.125       10
.25        15
.5         20   (Half the LD50 Dose)
1.0        25   (LD50 dose)
2.0        30   (Double the LD50 Dose)
4.0        35
8.0        40

For each doubling in administered dose, +5 is added to the TD. GM's should
note that, for poisons, an increased doseage administered will increase the
chance of the poison being detected.

All LD50 Doseages are given assuming roughly human body size and weight.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Size Factor: A number showing a creature's size relative to humans.
             Size Factor = 1.32^SR
             
Strength Factor: A number showing a creature's strength relative to humans.
                 Strength Factor = 1.32^STR
             
SR:     Size Rating, to be used in targeting rolls (OPTIONAL).
        SR = log1.32(Size Factor)

STR:    Strength Talent.
        STR = log1.32(Strength Factor)

Height: The average height of a humanoid creature with a certain STR, given 
        that it has the same proportions as a human.

LIFT:   The weight a character can lift overhead easily.
        (in kg unless otherwise indicated)
        Attempting to lift a weight equal to LIFT overhead has a TD of 5.
        For every increase in weight equal to LOAD STEP, increase TD by 1
        For every decrease in weight equal to LOAD STEP, decrease TD by 1
       
        Shortcut Formula: TD = -5 + ( (Weight-LIFT) / LOAD STEP )

LOAD:   LOAD is the amount of weight a character can carry before he will
        feel the effects of encumbrance.
        (in kg unless otherwise indicated)

        When a character carries a weight equal to or lower than LOAD, his
        Encumbrance Penalty is equal to 0.
        If the weight carried is greater than LOAD, then the Encumbrance
        Penalty is increase by 1 for every increase of weigth equal to
        the LOAD STEP (or a fraction of the load step).
        
        Shortcut Formula: (round up)
          Encumbrance Penalty = (Weight-LOAD) / LOAD STEP
        
        Example: STR = 0; LOAD = 20 kg; LOAD STEP = 2 kg
                 Weight <= 20kg   -> Encumbrance Penalty = 0
                 Weight = 20.5 kg -> Encumbrance Penalty = 1
                 Weight = 22 kg   -> Encumbrance Penalty = 1
                 Weight = 22.5 kg -> Encumbrance Penalty = 2
                 Weight = 24 kg   -> Encumbrance Penalty = 2
                 Weight = 35 kg   -> Encumbrance Penalty = (35-20)/2 = 8
                 
Humanoid Species: an example species of a given size and strength.

9.6.1.2 Weapon Descriptions
---------------------------

ARTICULATED
-----------

Flail
-----
Two stout sticks swiveled end to end. One stick serves as a handle while the
other thrashes about.

CONCUSSION
----------

Mace
----
Maces made all of iron or steel are found wherever body armor has
been used. Their weight and hardness, especially when focused into a
spike or narrow flange, made them more effective than any type of sword.
Although usually directed against the head, a mace blow on a limb could
break a bone even if the armor was not pierced. (from me: there've been
records showing attempts to ban the mace from the field by Europeans
during the medieval times because it was so effective in staving and
buckling armor -not to mention its ability to cripple its foe if not kill
him) -these attempts to ban them failed most likely because they were so
darned effective. They can be found either one handed or two handed
(heavy maces))

Maul
----

A heavy wooden hammer used to pound stakes into the ground.

DAGGERS/KNIVES
--------------

Misericorde
-----------
A dagger which was called the "dagger of mercy" with the idea
that it was used for the quick dispatch of a suffering loser; actually
it was the persuader which, presented point first to a fallen foe,
impelled him to plead for mercy and come across with a health ransom.

HAMMERS/AXES
------------

War Hammer
----------
After a a paragraph about battle axes...

A more simple, and perhaps more brutal weapon was the war-hammer. Although
called a hammer (implying a blunt head), in fact it usually had a pointed
head which was more in the nature of a pick. Such weaons were developed
by man primitive tribes and were comparable to stone or metal axes but
with a pointed shape. They were adopted in Europe during the 14th century
when chain mail and other forms of armour protection were in vogue. The
pointed head of a war-hammer proved to be an effective method of
defeating mail, provided that the point and head were thin enough, and it
could also be used to penetrate the joings of plate armour. With a
pointed head on one side of the weapon and a blunt head on the other,
the war-hammer became a twofold weapon in so far as the blunt head could
be used to stun the opponent or unhorse him, after which the pick could
be used to defeat his armour and give the finishing blow. The war-hammer
saw considerable use in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, but its
use declined as the armoured knight disappeared from the battlefield.

MISSILE
-------

African Throwing Irons
----------------------
A "throwing knife" used by various groups in Africa (Sudan, Bwaka,
Nigeria, and the Congo to name a few). These knives have multiple points
and come in various fancy shapes, having a center of gravity somewhere
above the handle from which the various points branch out. These tend to
be made of iron or steel and when thrown can pierce the traget "at almost
any attitude of impact". There doesn't appear to be a name for these -if
there is, it probably has a great many since it can be found all over Africa.

     Stones' "A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration and Use of
Arms and Armor" mentions these but also does not provide the native
name, additional information below is from that tome;
"...there are many special forms of knife made to be thrown that would
be of little use if handled the ordinary way. They are used
extensively in Central Africa and are of the most extraordinary
shapes. They are thrown horizontally from right to left and may hit
with any one of the branches. The trajectory is a curve that inclines
towards the right of the thrower. The maximum range is said to be
about 100 yards; at 40 to 50 is is quite accurate. "Certain travellers
relate that this arm thrown by a skillful hand can cut off a man's leg
at 20 metres. Trials at the Musee du Congo Belge showed that when
thrown from distances of 15 metres some of these throwing knives would
go through a board 15 mm in thickness" (Congo, Feb 1922 p.1) (added by
Lbeals)

Quoit (Chakram)
-----
One of the more remarkable thrown missiles was the Sikh chakram or
throwing quoit, a simple circle of metal with a sharp outer circumference,
which could be spun and then released with considerable velocity and
accuracy. (Range: 25 meters)

POLEARMS
--------

Bill
----
A long shafted weapon having its head a hooklike cutting blade with
a beak at the back.

Fauchard
----------
A larger glave with a few spurs on its unsharpened side.

Glaive
------
A big knife blade on a pole.

Guisarme
----------
A bill with two or three extra spikes

Halberd
----------
A pole axe with a longer spear part and a crescent-shaped blade.

Partisan
--------
A oxtongue with a couple of curved points at the base of the blade.

Pole axe
--------
A battle-axe on a long pole.

SPEARS
------

Oxtongue
--------
A spear with a two-edged blade with a pole for a handle.

SWORDS
------

Falchion
----------
In war, though not in tournaments, the falchion became deservedly
popular. It was a real snickersnee -- a sword, but built more like a
knife or a cleaver, and nearly three feet long, with a single, curved
cutting edge supported by a very thick-backed blade, which gave it weight
and authority.

Shamshir
--------
Referred to by Europeans as a scimitar. For game purposes, I would group with
this weapon the Saif and the Kilij. All of these blades are curved and single
edged (except the kilij -specifics will be discussed later on) and the
distinctive middle eastern cross shaped guard. The Shamshir has a blade length
of roughly 80 cm (in a straight line -this length would be longer if the blade
were straightened) and tends to be thinner than the saif. The differences
between the shamshir and the saif is that the saif tends to be a bit shorter
and broader and can be found with a groove in the blade (I wouldn't call it a
blood groove since the usage of these particular blades are in the draw cut
style and tend not to employ stabbing motions). The Kilij is more similar to
the shamshir with the exception that the blade broadens near the tip usually
and has a straight sharpened edge on the back  of the blade (only near the
tip). The Saif is Arab in origin, the Shamshir Persian, and the Kilij Turkish.

Shotel
------
The shotel is an Ethiopean sword with a blade that extends
straightward for about 7 cm or so then curves in a crescent arc ending in
a steadily tapered point. It is double edged and the curvature is meant
to be used to reach around an opponent's shield.

Not found in the compendium (do we want to keep those)
---------------------------

Hand-and-a-half (Long)
---------------
This type of sword was generally used when dismounted,
since it demanded the use of both hands to develop the necessary force
of blow.

9.6.1.3 Non-Human Weapons
-------------------------

If a weapon has not been designed to be used by humans, then its impact
can be calculated from:

   Weapon Impact = Human Weapon Impact + Species STR
      Human Weapon Impact: given in the Human Weapons table (below)
      Species STR: average strength of the species for which the weapon was
                   made (given in the species description).

For example, a pixie longsword would do an impact of:
   Pixie Longsword Impact = Human Longsword Impact + Pixies average STR
                          = 2d6+4 + (-6)
                          = 2d6-2

-----------
9.6.2 Armor
-----------

The armour types listed below are based on the Palladium "Compendium of
Weapons, Armour and Castles". Resistance is an approximate average of cut,
chop, thrust and impact resistance. Some values have been modified for game
balance.

 Armor             Resistance       Mass*       FATIGUE modifier

+---------+-------+--------+---------+--------+

Size: The size of the shield (diameter or height) in meters.

Weigth: The mass of the shield in kilograms.

Defense bonus: A bonus to the defense skill on the relative size of the
shield.
               This bonus accounts for the fact that merely wielding a shield
               provides a limited amount of cover.

Bash IMPACT: The amount of impact done when the shield is used in an attack.

=======================
Title: (Not yet decided upon a title)
Author: Tom
Game World: (?)
Location(s): This is a maritime adventure with possibility of piracy. The
  technology can be called enlightened medeval. The naval technology reaches
  out into the 18th century as far as sailing technology is concerned. There
  is no gun powder, however, so there are no guns or cannons. The world has no
  moon, instead it has a second sun which is somewhat brighter than the moon
  illuminating the sky at very dark levels of twilight illumination when the
  yellow sun is absent from the night sky. The year is 400 days long with each
  season lasting 100 days. There are no months since there is no moon. There
