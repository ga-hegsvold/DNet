<sect1><title>Movement</title>
<para>
There are five basic speeds for characters movement. The Base speed is a
very slow walk, the Walking speed is a good long distance pace and the
Running speed is a normal jogging. The Sprinting speed is the highest speed
at which most characters can go and the Max speed is the absolute
maximum speed at which a member of a given Species can go (for humans, the
maximum speed is that of olympic sprinters).

</para>

<para>
Characters have to make movement checks periodically to continue moving at
the same speed. The TD is increased before making the movement check.
</para>

<para>
* For speeds below the sprinting speed, the check is made using the Endurance
skill:
</para>

<para>
<literal>
d10-d10* + Endurance &gt;= Movement TD
</literal>
</para>

<para>
** For speed at or over the sprinting speed, the check is made using the
Sprinting skill:
</para>

<para>
<literal>
d10-d10* + Sprinting &gt;= Movement TD
</literal>
</para>

<para>
If a character fails a check, he must slow down. If he was Running he starts
Walking, if he was Sprinting he goes down to Running, ...
The TD of the movement check remains the same (except if the character goes
from Max speed to Sprinting, in which case the TD is reduced by 10).
</para>

<para>
When the character wants to move at the Max speed, he must make an initial
movement check. Failure indicates that he can move at most at the Sprinting
speed. The TD is not increased before this initial check.
</para>

<para>
The GM is free to change the period at which the checks are made, converting
the TD increase appropriately (Sprinting could require one check per 15
minutes, with a TD increase of 1). See Advanced Movement for more complete
movement rules.
</para>

<sect2><title>Movement Skills</title>
<para>
For movement slower than Sprinting, players should use the Endurance Skill
in the movement check, or Fitness if their character does not possess the
Endurance Skill. For movement at or above the Sprinting speed, players should
use the Sprinting Skill or Strength in the movement check.
</para>

<para>
If a character does not have a Training in either Endurance or Sprinting, he
does not face an Untrained Penalty (UP = 0). These Skills are considered to be
common enough that everyone has a basic Training in them.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Chases</title>
<para>
If a Chase takes place in a crowded environment, the participants must make
an additional Agility check every round. This check is made against the current
movement TD:
</para>

<para>
<literal>
d10-d10* + AGI &gt;= Movement TD
</literal>
</para>

<para>
Each participant that passes the check can move at the full Sprinting speed
or over, otherwise he can only move at the Running speed or less. Of course,
if the character attempts to go over the Sprinting speed, he must have
passed a movement check before he can make the Agility check.
</para>

<para>
If the graded outcomes system is used, a Partial indicates that the
participant moves a bit slower than Sprinting (generally Sprinting minus
Base, but the GM can change this). A Mishap indicates that he has tripped,
or any other unfortunate event that the GM can devise, while a Bonus allows
him to cover an extra distance equal to his Base speed.
</para>

<para>
If the Chase occurs on clear and level ground, the same method can be used
except that Agility is replaced by Strength in the check...
