When other means of achieving objectives have failed, the party of adventuring
characters may find themselves in an encounter that leads to combat. Combat
can take many forms including melee, archery, arcane, etc.  Good combat
rules should cover all those situations, while being simple enough not to
prevent the players from having fun.

Like everything else in the DNet system, combat rules seek to achieve a
balance between realism, simplicity and heroism. In a completely realistic
system, serious wounds often prove fatal and the GM has to take great care not
to create a situation where combat is unavoidable. At the opposite,
in a heroic system where the characters can endure extreme wounds without
flinching, combat often becomes the preferred mean to resolve situations of
conflict. In our vision, combat should not limit character development by
ending it whenever it happens, nor should it prevent it by being a universal
solution to all problems. Therefore, the DNet combat system is deadly
enough that characters won't always seek combat as the solution to their
problems, but not so deadly as to make the characters flee each time brute
force is required.
