<para>
There are five types of unarmed attacks. For game mechanics, they are
handled the same way as weapons are handled in armed combat styles.
They have an associated damage, reach, etc, just as weapons do.
An unarmed defender against a weapon gets no defence or a penalty, depending
on the fighting style being used.

<sect2><title>Unarmed weapon types</title>
<para>
Attacks with hands or fists do 2d6-8 IMPACT.
</para>

<para>
Kicking attacks to 2d6-6 IMPACT.  
</para>

<para>
Bashing attacks include body slams and tackles. IMPACT is 2d6-4.
A running start is required to do damage, so no IMPACT is done if you are
already at close range. (possible to force backwards even if starting at close
range)
</para>

<para>
Throws include leg sweeps and judo/wrestling throws. IMPACT is 2d6-6 and
is not modified by STR. Success leaves the defender prone.
</para>

<para>
Hold attacks include judo holds and wrestling pins.  
After a successful attack the defender must make a roll if he wants to
try to break the hold.  
</para>

<para>
<literal>
d10-d10* + STR + skill &gt;= holder's STR + skill

</para>

<para>
The "skill" may be from any style which includes "hold" attacks.
If the hold is successful, the attacker may choose to inflict damage:

<para>
<literal>
IMPACT is 2d6-4 (+STR).

</para>

<para>
* Note about HANDS: There are holds and throws which require two hands,
and some which require no hands. The GM may judge if a maneuver is possible
or more difficult (skill penalty) in some situations, such as if the player has
his hands bound.

<sect2><title>Unarmed Combat Styles</title>
<para>
I would like to use a minimal list of unarmed combat styles, since it is
more in the spirit of the current weapon styles. A well rounded martial
artist using this list would learn Karate for the hand and foot maneuvers,
Close Weapons for the usual list of Chinese peasant weapons, Judo for
the throws, Staff, and One-Handed Weapon skills.
