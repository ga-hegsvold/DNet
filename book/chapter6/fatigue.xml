<sect1><title>Fatigue in Combat</title>
<para>
In combat, be it melee or missile combat, the Fatigue heap must be increased
every 5 rounds (30 seconds), no matter what actions are performed (fighting,
moving, dodging, tending a wounded comrade, ...). As usual, Fatigue is
increased by 1 plus the Encumbrance Penalty.

<para>
If a character does not perform any action (he just stands there), then his
Fatigue does not increase.
