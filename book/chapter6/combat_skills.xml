<para>
One of the fundamental premises behind the DNet combat system is that one's
fighting style is more important than the actual weapon used. A fighter used
to fighting with a broad sword and a shield will find it much easier to fight
with a bastard sword and a shield than to fight with a broad sword alone. His
combat reflexes are tuned to certain strike sequences relying on the shield
to parry blows. For him, fighting without the shield means developping new
strike sequences, something that is not always easy to do in the middle of
a melee.

<formalpara><title>2nd rank</title>
<para>
Extended weapon reach to attack opponents from a distance, as from behind a
line of friendly shield bearers.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Fend</title>
<para>
Basically Fend keeps opponent with shorter weapon at a distance unable to
attack. Opponent who loses against Fend either cannot attack or takes automatic
hit at full Damage (maximum for thrusting weapon and STR bonus).
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
A Fend can be started if an opponent is outside of Close range at the start of
a combat round. Otherwise, a successful Fend means that an opponent who is at
Close range is unable to attack in the next round. A successful Fend must occur
in each subsequent round to keep the opponent at bay.
</para>

<formalpara><title>Entangle</title>
<para>
Entangle limbs. A successful attack will entangle the limbs of the
defender, unless an Agility check against a TD equal to the attacker's total
roll is made by the defender. The attacker must specify that he is trying
to entangle during the declaration phase.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Trip</title>
<para>
Entangle legs and trip opponent. A successful attack will entangle the
legs of the defender, unless an Agility check against a TD equal to the
attacker's total roll is made by the defender. The attacker must specify
that he is trying to trip during the declaration phase.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Shield Bonus</title>
<para>
The use of a shield gives a bonus to defense of 2 plus the shield bonus, 
which depends on the type of shield.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
<emphasis>
Optional: Instead of the fixed +2 defense bonus, the Shield Use skill
gives a +1 bonus for every 5 levels, i.e. +1 at levels 1 through 5, 
+2 at levels 6 through 10, +3 at levels 11 through 15, ...
</emphasis>
</para>

<formalpara><title>Shield Bash</title>

check against a TD equal to the attacker's total roll is made.

Kicking attacks to 2d6-6 Impact.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Bash</title>
<para>
Bashing attacks include body slams and tackles. Impact is 2d6-4.
A running start is required to do Damage, so no Impact is done if you are
already at Close range. (possible to force backwards even if starting at Close
range)
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Throw</title>
<para>
Throws include leg sweeps and judo/wrestling throws. IMPACT is 2d6-6 and
is not modified by STR. Success leaves the defender prone.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Hold</title>
<para>
Hold attacks include judo holds and wrestling pins.  
After a successful attack the defender must make a roll if he wants to
try to break the hold.

<para>
* Note about HANDS: There are holds and throws which require two hands,
and some which require no hands. The GM may judge if a maneuver is possible
or more difficult (skill penalty) in some situations, such as if the player has
his hands bound.
</para>

<sect2><title>Long Range Styles</title>
<formalpara><title>Archery</title>
<para>
Any (non-cross) bow. Rate of Fire (ROF) is generally one arrow per round.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Cross Bows</title>
<para>
All crossbows. ROF will be determined by weapon and Strength. High Strength
crossbow weapons may only allow occasional fire 1/3 rounds to 1/10 rounds.
If there is a 1/1 rate of fire, damage is minimal e.g. per dagger.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Thrown Weapons</title>
<para>
Any weapon which can be thrown. Effectiveness is greatly limited with weapons
that were not designed to be thrown. Weapons designed to be thrown -- axe,
knives, boomerang, darts, javelin, discus, etc.
ROF is 1 per round if the weapon is appropriately carried on the body
(at girdle or similar -- not in pack). When throwing into a melee situation,
ROF is reduced to 1/2 rounds or roll randomly for target.
</para>
</formalpara>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Melee Styles</title>
<formalpara><title>Articulated Weapons</title>
<para>
Any articulated weapon. Leveraged weapons (like a flail) are harder to use than
a more straightforward weapon. This covers all such weapons, one or two handed,
when used without a shield. If a shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied
to the Skill.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Articulated Weapons &amp; Shield</title>
<para>
Any one handed articulated weapon used with a shield.
Leveraged weapons (like a flail) are harder to use than a more
straightforward weapon. This covers all such one handed weapons, when used
with a shield. If no shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the 
skill.

<formalpara><title>Bolas/Whips/Ropes/Nets</title>
<para>
Bolas, whips, ropes and nets.
</para>

<formalpara><title>Close Weapons</title>

Weapons such as knives, daggers, brass knuckles, etc.
Opponents must be at Close range. If not they can Fend. If a shield is used,
a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Close Weapons &amp; Shield</title>
<para>
Weapons such as knives, daggers, brass knuckles, etc.
Opponents must be at Close range. If not they can Fend. If no 
shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Dual Weapon</title>
<para>
Any 2 weapons which can be wielded with one hand.
Comments: minus on defense, or limit defense as in previous post. (i.e.
can not defend against weapons more than one `class' larger than secondary
weapon without loosing attack. Limit weapons to those smaller than medium
with respect to character size/strength.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Fencing</title>
<para>
Fencing defense can only occur against Fencing and Close Weapons.
Against other Styles, reduce Def to 1.
Parry repost style fighting with light weight weapons -- edge or point attacks.
This is not for unbalanced weapons like axe or mace.

<formalpara><title>One-handed Weapons</title>

If a shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.

</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>One-Handed Weapons &amp; Shield</title>
<para>
Any non-articulated weapon which can be wielded with one hand.
If no shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Polearms</title>
<para>
Halbards, poles with ax, blade, pick, or exotic ends of reach 2 to 2.5.
Pole arms are commonly swung, having blade or pick. They have a
higher moment of inertia than Two-Handed Weapons. They also have some closer
grip style that allows some parry action with the either end ala quarter
staff. Most wielders of pole arms do not like to use that style, prefering
to use weapon from 2nd rank. If the weapon has a spear point, it may also
be used in Thrusting Weapons Style.

<formalpara><title>Staves</title>
<para>
All staves.
</para>

<formalpara><title>Thrusting Weapons</title>
<para>
Any spear weapon. Includes pike which is a reach 3 spear.
This to cover spears and such. Thrusting style does not use nether end for
block, but forward shaft. Thrusting Style also includes Fend as an alternative
to attack and defend.
If a shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Thrusting Weapons &amp; Shield</title>
<para>
Any one-handed spear weapon. Includes pike which is a reach 3 spear.
(*pike is one-handed?)
This to cover spears and such. This includes shield use for smaller shields.
Thrusting weapon may be one handed with shield. Thrusting Style does not use
nether end for block, but forward shaft. Thrusting Style also includes Fend as
an alternative to attack and defend.
If no shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.

Any non-articulated weapon which can be wielded with two hands.
</para>

<sect2><title>Unarmed Styles</title>
<para>
I would like to use a minimal list of unarmed combat styles, since it is
more in the spirit of the current weapon styles. A well rounded martial
artist using this list would learn Karate for the hand and foot maneuvers,
Close Weapons for the usual list of Chinese peasant weapons, Judo for
the throws, Staff, and One-Handed Weapon skills.

For example,
if a fighter wants to attack one opponent and Dodge two others, the Style 
actions (attack and defense) and the Dodge action (evading the blows from the
two other opponents) will be rolled with a -5 penalty. If the Dodge Skill is
used in conjunction with a shield, the bearer can add the shield bonus to his
defense roll.
