<para>
While it may be possible for some characters to cover 60 meters in a standard
6 seconds round, this is not a typical character nor a character loaded with
equipment. Even if he was, he would be in no condition at the end of the round
to carry out other actions. Moreover this speed allows for only the gentlest
of turns; Combat movement involves turns and other actions.
</para>

<para>
The maximum speed that a character can move at in melee and still be able to
perform other actions without penalty is the base movement speed. A human
character might move up to 5 meters during a round and attack without penalty.
</para>

<para>
If a character wants to move faster than the Base movement speed in melee
combat, the GM can require him to make an Agility check against a TD
ranging from 0 to 5. A character can always move at the Base movement speed
without a check (as long as he is not crippled).
</para>

<para>
When moving in a combat situation, a character must increase his Fatigue Heap
at least every 5 rounds (30 seconds). He may have to increase his Fatigue more
often if he manages to move very fast (above the sprinting speed).
