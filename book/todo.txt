INTRODUCTION
Implement Coversion rules - or not... at least make it a seperate document.
- the only interesting aspects of this would be how to convert species,
    attributes, special abilites, etc. from AD&D Planescape to DNet.

GENERAL RULES
Kan bruke Death i stedenfor BOD+25 ved Healing rate/day.
Dette vil tilsi at et gjennomsnittlig menneske med 40 injury vi være
frisk i løpet av en uke hvis en healer er tilstedet.

Movement
Fatigue calculation formula:

  2^mult
( ------ + [Enc] * [FAT increase/hour] ) * h = FATIGUE (round down)
     4

When movement time is in minutes:

  2^mult                              [minutes moved]
( ------ + [Enc] * [FAT increase] ) * --------------- = FATIGUE
     4                                       60

When movement time is in seconds:

  2^mult                              [seconds moved]
( ------ + [Enc] * [FAT increase] ) * --------------- = FATIGUE
     4                                     3600

|            |Mult|  km/hour    m/round  |  Base TD  | FAT increase |
+------------|----+----------------------+-----------+--------------+
| Base       | x1 |     3           5    |   -5      | 1/2 hours    |
| Walking    | x2 |     6          10    |   -5      | 1/hour       |
| Running    | x4 |    12          20    |   -5      | 4/hour       |
| Sprinting* | x8 |    24          40    |   -5      | 64/hour      |
| Max**      |x12 |    36          60    |   15      | 1024/hour    |
+------------+----+----------------------+-----------+--------------+

Ex:
Running for 30 minutes with an Encumbrance penalty of 2
(when running you have FAT increase 4 times an hour)

     2^4             30 min             1
=> ( --- + 2 * 4 ) * ------ = (4 + 8) * - = 6 FATIGUE
      4              60 min             2

Ex:
Sprinting for 100 seconds with no penalty

     2^8              100 s    6400
=> ( --- + 0 * 64 ) * ------ = ---- = 1.77...8 = 1 FATIGUE
      4               60^2 s   3600

This calculation might slow down gameplay considerably, so feel free to
drop it and just improvise.

- 6.5 Healing 

     Activity                   - Per day -       Weekly
     level     Example     w/o Healer  w/healer*   bonus

     High      Fighting        0          1          0

     * conditions apply (ref. Medicine skill)

Healing rates per day are based on a percentage of the injured person's BODY Talent increased by 25. 

Weekly bonus: Requires a successful Fitness roll vs Injury:

              d10-d10 + 10 + FIT >= INJURY.

              If successful, INJURY is reduced by the indicated roll.

- 6.7 Lifting Weight

     d10-d10 >= Lift TD [+ Fatigue]

     Lift at head height              -7                 (10)
     Lift overhead                    -5                 (10)
     --------------------------------------------------------

     For every increase in weight equal to LOAD STEP, increase TD by 1
     For every decrease in weight equal to LOAD STEP, decrease TD by 1

     Shortcut Formula: 

          TD = Lift TD + ( (Weight-LIFT) / LOAD STEP )
