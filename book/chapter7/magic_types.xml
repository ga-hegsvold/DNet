<sect1><title>Magic Types Guidelines</title>
<para>
Magic can come in many types and flavors. The GM will probably decide on the
types of magic depending on the type of world that is being played in. The
magic types in the standard world 'Corellus' provide good examples of how to
set up the types of magic.
</para>

<para>
The first thing that needs to be decided is what types of magical energy are
available for use. These are the sources that the players can use. Are there
any restrictions on these sources (e.g., priestly sources have the
restriction that the priest must be in good favor with that deity). Sources
have a base EP cost associated with them that reflects how hard it is to
draw on that source.
</para>

<para>
The next decision is, how can these sources be manipulated. These will be the
conductors. The conductors also usually have a base cost associated with them.
Other modifiers can be used from the table above.

<para>
The game master can also decide that each form of magic is associated with a
different vision of the world and that a single individual cannot embrace
more than one.

<example><title>Magic Limitations</title>
<screen>
A magician specialized in the Elemental theory would not be able to perform
any Celestial spell, and might also have some difficulty with Psionics.

<para>
Once again, this kind of limitations are very world specific.

A template for magic types can be found in section 9.5.
