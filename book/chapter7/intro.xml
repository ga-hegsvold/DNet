Like every other aspect of DNet, the magic system is essentially made up
of skills and tasks which use those skills. In the specific case of the magic
system, the skills are those which give a character the capability to cast a
magical spell, and the tasks are: first, the use of source skills to access
the power for the spell, and second, the use of conductor skills to actually
cast the spell.

types of magic and spells are just that: guidelines.
