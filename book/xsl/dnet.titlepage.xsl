Introduction

What is DragonNet?
DragonNet RPG

DragonNet (DNet) is a Role Playing Game (RPG) developed by a group of
volunteers over the Internet. The game is donated to the gaming community as
described under copyright and license. We hope that you enjoy our game. We
encourage you to use it; to change parts that don't fit in your game worlds;
to create new monsters, spells and rules; and to share your creative efforts
with other gamers.



Why Another RPG?

There are a lot of RPG systems out there. Almost everybody has their
favorites. Everybody has played AD&amp;D (tm). There are new games every year.
Why another one? Well, we weren't happy with the other games we've seen
for several reasons. We felt that if we could use what we've learned from
years of gaming experience, we could develop a system that corrected the
mistakes and imbalances of other games. We hope we've accomplished that. 



"First Kill all the Lawyers" - William Shakespeare


As many of you know, TSR has recently cracked down on the distribution of
user created materials for use with their AD&amp;D (tm) game. The letter
posted to rec.games.frp.dnd written by a TSR lawyer to a sysadmin 
caused quite a stir. Was there a company that provided a game where 
users were encouraged to develop material for the game and use it 
freely? We couldn't find one so we decided to develop our own.



The intellectual property owned by some game company is not what makes
role-playing an enjoyable hobby. (We argue it is their intellectual
property that causes many of the problems!) We decided to develop our own
fantasy RPG that would meet the needs of the net.community. One that could
be enjoyed without fear of legal retaliation. 



Open Systems Development Philosophy

Unix is a popular computer operating system for two primary reasons. One:
it's free (usually), and Two it uses an open system architecture. Computer
operating systems and RPG's actually have a lot in common. They are simply
a set of logical rules combined with a syntax. This combination results in
a system where user defined modules interact. RPG mechanics are also a set
of rules and syntax for the purpose of role playing or story-telling. If
Unix can be successful as a free system with open system architecture,
DNet should be successful as a free open-system RPG.



You already know what free means, and it's nice not to have to shell out
$20.00 for the latest RPG game. Not to mention the continual drain on your
pocketbook for the latest supplement. So what does open-system
architecture mean? Well simply it means that you know all the information
that was used to design the system. You are free to tinker with the insides
of the system. You can change it. Improve it. Distribute it. Expand it.
Bend it. Fold it. Mutilate it. Staple and spindle it.



In fact we knew when we started this project we wouldn't have the time to
fully develop every aspect of a good RPG. We hope you will take the
opportunity to carve out a portion of reality. Study it carefully. Ponder
it as you read through our Designer's Notes. Write up your new material
and distribute it to the gaming world. That is after all why we started
DNet. We felt it would serve our own self interest. We want to see what you
can develop. 



Design Philosophy

If you want to design materials for use with DNet you have two options.
You can develop unnofficial material yourself. Or you can join
the DragonNet Team. Either way, you'll want to understand the design
philosophy we employed in creating the DNet game. 



The Quest for Realism

Almost all of us started RPG's with one of the early RPG systems. It was
fun for a while, but as we progressed they lost some of their charm.
Perhaps our character had progressed to beyond the 10th level and game
balance was forever lost. Maybe we no longer felt we had enough options,
or it seemed stupid that our fighter could dive off a 100 foot cliff into
solid rock and pick himself off the ground with relatively minor injuries.
In any event, we decided we could improve the system. We started by
working within the systems framework. Soon we exhausted all the
possibilities. Many of the problems were fundamental flaws in the games
themselves unable to be easily fixed without causing major problems
somewhere else. Next we moved on to other systems. We tried RuneQuest(tm)
or RoleMaster(tm). Then we moved on to "third generation" games such as
Hero (tm) or G.U.R.P.S. (tm). Still we were unsatisfied. We questioned why.
These games were rich with detail. The realism we craved was there. Why
did they lack the charm of those first RPG sessions? 



The reason we believe is that realism is not the grail RPG designers
should seek. Adding realism for it's own sake takes away the wonder of the
game. The mechanics begin to bog down the flow of play. We lose the drama
inherent in the plot. The story becomes dull. The game unplayed. The true
alignment principle game designers should strive for is elegance. An RPG
can be realistic to the extent that it uses simple, fast moving mechanics.
Gritty realism is less important than plausibility. An RPG is much like a
novel. Many realistic games get bogged down in the mechanics. This is as
dangerous for a GM as concentrating on technique alone would be for a
writer. The RPG system is there to enhance the story. The story is not a
vehicle for the RPG system. 



Simplicity vs. Complexity

Within the context of an elegant game, simplicity is key. When game
mechanics are simple and can be handled quickly they contribute to an
enjoyable role playing session. When they are bulky, get in the way, or
require frequent die rolls or multiple table lookups we lose the sense of
action, the drama of the events happening in the game world. Complexity is
an enemy that must be guarded against. If we fail to be watchful it creeps
into our systems. It destabilizes game balance and slows the play. The
rules drive the game. This is not what a RPG should be. 



Key Development Principles
Simplicity

DNet should be a very simple game to play.
All the numbers needed for play should be available on the player's character
sheet. Non-player-character (NPC) stats should easily fit on a A5 card.
Table lookups should be infrequent or non-existent, particularly during play.
Only a limited number of dice should be used (d10 and d6). Dice mechanics
should be similar, and there should be no more than 2 or 3 varieties.
Skill and Talent checks should occur in basically the same manner.
Simplicity should not however preclude the richness of systems enjoyed by
experienced players.



Intuitive

DNet should be intuitive. Jargon and acronymns should be avoided.
High die rolls should be good, low rolls bad. Game abstractions should make
sense relative to the real world. This should not be confused with realism.
DNet is not a detailed, gritty, realistic system. Abstractions have a basis in
reality. As an example in AD&amp;D (tm), hit points are an abstraction that
includes luck, skill, endurance and physical health. When you lose hit points
in AD&amp;D (tm) you are not necessarily taking wounds.
This kind of abstraction should be avoided.



Flexible

DNet as a licensed game will be available for all Game Masters (GMs) to tinker
with. This should be encouraged, even built into the system. Each section of
the game, Character Creation, Combat, Magic, etc. should have a set of basic
rules that are easy to play, understand and use. Each section should also have
a set of advanced rules that add flavor to the game. These advanced rules
should allow characters to move seamlessly between the systems. All advanced
rules would be strictly optional. GMs could pick and choose among the optional
rules they will use.



Expandable

DNet is an Open-System design. As such, it should be easily expandable by the
user. The game design should be such that players and GMs can easily add
Species, Cultures, Careers, Skills, Spells, etc. without disturbing game
balance or violating the integrity of the system.



Quality

DNet should be a high quality product. Suitable for publication by any of the
major game publishing companies. It should include quality color artwork, be
well written and meticulously edited. It should be made available through
anonymous ftp as text, postscript, and through www as hypertext formats.

Terms and Concepts

To play a DNet game, there are a few terms that must be known.
We've tried to keep terminology to a minimum, but it inevitably creeps in.
Where we have specific terms for RPG constructs, we have tried to make them as
intuitive as possible.


Talent

Talent (Tal) describes a character's natural ability in a particular area.
A character's Strength Talent is a measure of their ability to lift loads,
carry weight and deal damage in combat. Other systems refer to a characters
natural abilities as attributes or abilities. We use the term Talent.



Training

Training (Tr) is the amount of learned experience a character has in a given
Skill or area. This includes formal and informal education, obtained at a
university or the school of hard knocks. A character gains training
through practice, study and use of Skills. Experience can be used to 
increase a characters Training Level (Tr Lvl) in a Skill.



Skill

Skill (Sk) is the effectiveness of a character in a particular area. Skill
includes both the characters natural Talents and his Level of Training.




Sk = Avg(Tals) + Tr Lvl




DNet is a Skill based system, so most of a character's abilities will be
described as Skills.



Heaps

Heaps are numeric values that start at 0 and go up. High Heap values are
bad and low Heap values are good.



Some Heaps used in DNet:



Encumbrance





Fatigue





Injury






Heaps work similarly to Task Difficulties (TDs), except that they are variable.
For example, when a character takes sufficient Injury, he makes a survival
check by rolling dice and comparing the result (modified by appropriate Talents
or Skills) to his Injury Heap.






Dice

Tasks

Characters in RPGs are constantly trying to do things.
Picking pockets, casting Spells, haggling the price of an item with a
shopkeeper, etc. Whenever a character attempts to do something, it is
referred to as a Task. DNet uses the same consistent format for all
Tasks. Whether you are swinging a sword, picking a lock, or fast-talking
a town guardsman, you will always use the same game mechanics.


Task Resolution

Tasks are resolved by rolling dice, adding the characters Skill or Talent to
the die roll, and comparing the result to a TD.
If the die roll plus the Skill or Talent is greater or equal than the TD,
the Task succeeds. If it is less, the attempt fails.




Optionally, the GM may use the amount by which the attempt fails or succeeds to
determine the degree of success or failure.




Two ten sided dice are rolled for Task Resolution.
DNet uses an open-ended die roll method designated d10-d10* (See Reroll Method).


Weapon Impact

Two six sided dice are used for weapon Impact.


Experience

Experience Points (EP) can be awarded with Experience Dice (d6). Some GMs may
not like this level of randomness, and are free to set EPs as a fixed
amount as outlined in the section on experience. In that case the dice
range can be used as a guide.


Reroll Method

For Task Resolution, DNet uses two ten sided dice of contrasting colors.
Each dice can generate a result from 1 to 10: the 0 on the dice is considered
to be a 10.



Before rolling, choose which dice will be the positive dice and which will be
the negative one. In the examples below, the white dice is positive, while
the black one is negative. You then roll the two dice and substract the
negative one from the positive one.



d10-d10

White dice (+): 6
Black dice (-): 7
Result:        -1





When you roll a 10 on one (or both) dice, you compute the partial result and
reroll the 10, adding or substracting the new roll, as appropriate. If you
also roll a 10 on the reroll, you add it to the partial result and reroll
again. You reroll as long as you keep rolling 10s... or until the GM asks to
verify your dice. ;)



Using this method is denoted as d10-d10* throughout the rules.



d10-d10*

White dice (+):  10
Black dice (-):  2
Partial result:  8
White dice (+):  3
Final result:    11

White dice (+):  7
Black dice (-):  10
Partial result:  -3
Black dice (-):  3
Final result:    -6

White dice (+):  10
Black dice (-):  10
Partial result:  0
White dice (+):  10
Black dice (-):  3
Partial result:  7
White dice (+):  1
Final result:    8








Character Creation

Steps for Completing a Character

Following is a basic outline describing the steps involved in creating a
character for DNet. Each of these steps will be detailed in the
following sections.





Ask your GM what kind of character he needs in his campaign.





Think of a character concept you want to roleplay that fits in the campaign.





Ask your GM for the Experience Level of his campaign.





Select a Species.





Ask your GM for the genre of the game (Realistic, Heroic or Highly Heroic).
Use this genre to determine the number of Talent Points (TPs) your character
will start out with and use them to buy starting Talents.


If your GM prefers, you may roll randomly for starting Talents.





Select Gifts and/or Foibles if desired.
Gifts have a positive EP Cost. Foibles have a negative EP Cost.
Subtract these costs from your free EP.





Select Culture.





Select Career(s).





Record the Skills and their EP bonus that come with the Career(s).






Add non-Career Skills if you want, and advance Skills and/or Talents.





Record unused EP on your character template for later use.





Flesh out the character with general appearance, personality and background.





Character Concept

The character concept is a general idea of what you want your character to be
like, something that you find interesting.
Try to envision your character's personality, species, background, gender, and
even appearance.



During the character creation you can always change and alter this concept to
suit your ideas, but at least it gives you a starting point.



By answering the following six basic questions you can create a solid,
believable character: Who, What, When, Where, Why and How.


Who?

This question helps define the character's personality by identifying
the people around him. Defining who the character is inculdes determening
aspects such as:


Who were the character's parents?
Who were the character's childhood friends?
Who are the character's friends/enemies?
Who are the character's most common foes?
Who does the character talk to when he's upset?
Who does the character love/hate?
Who does the character trust?
Who does the character work for (if any)?
Who started the character on the road to be an adventurer?


This question not only helps define the character, but also other NPCs in the
campaign world.



What?

This question answers more about the character's life, history and current
status.


What did the character do for a living before he became an adventurer?
What prompted the character to become an adventurer?
What color is the character's hair/eyes?
What is the character's age?
What does the character do in his free time - when he's not on the road as an adventurer?
What does the character do when he's alone?
What are the character's favorite foods, music, books?
What is the character's personality like?
What are the character's ethnic, educational and social backgrounds?




When?

Answering this question sets the time frame for the character and for many of
the other questions.


When was the character born?
When did the character decide to become an adventurer?
When did the character arrive where he is now (city/planet/plane of existence)?
When does the character get up in the morning/go to bed?
When does the character practice his Skills?
When does the character visit his family/friends?
When did the character meet the other characters?




Where?

Answers to this question gives the locations for the events in the characters
life. They provide a home and anchor for the character.


Where was the character born/raised?
Where does the character live when he's not on the road adventuring?
Where does the character practice his Skills?
Where did the character learn his Skills?
Where did the character go on his last vacation?
Where is the character's favorite resturant?




Why?

These are probably the most important questions. These questions define the
character's motivation and commitment to do what he sees as right.


Why did the character first decide to become an adventurer?
Why is the character where he is now?
Why does the character work with the other characters?
Why does the character use the weapon he does?
Why did the character choose to learn and improve the Skills he has?




How?

These questions round out many of the earlier questions.


How did the character gain his weapons and his fighting Skills?
How does the character use his abilities (silly stunts, combat tactics, etc.)?
How does the character pass the time between adventures?
How does the character get around every day (by foot, horse, special abilities)?
How does the character maintain a "normal" life and still find time to be an adventurer?





These questions are just samples. You can go into as much depth as you like.
When you are satisfied it's time to move on to the next step in the character
creation prosess.

Experience Level

The average Experience Level of characters in the GM's campaign.






Starting:
Characters have few Skills. Difficult Skills have low Training Levels.





Moderate:
Characters have some Skills. Difficult Skills have moderate Training Levels.





High:
Characters have many Skills. Difficult Skills have high Training Levels.





Very High:
Characters have lots of Skills. Difficult Skills have very high Training levels.




EP

The number of EP associated with the campaign's Experience Level. EP are
used for selecting a Species, buying Gifts and Foibles, and buying Skills.




The EP values listed represent the experience points that a character has
accumulated throughout his lifetime. It quantifies the achievements the
character has made since childhood and the experience the character has
obtained from those achievements.



GMs are encouraged to assign their own EP values if those listed do not
fit with the GM's personal rate of awarding experience.


BC

Base Cost. The base EP cost of a Skill.



Maximum Starting Tr Lvl (Optional)


Listed as an optional rule to control how much Training a player can
acquire for a Skill at character creation. It simulates the fact that at
lower Experience Levels a character has not had enough time to develop
Skills to high Levels of mastery. In particular, harder Skills would not
have been developed as much as the easier Skills. If GMs have no problem
with characters beginning with Skills starting out at any Training Level,
then they can ignore this option.






The numbers in the table indicate the maximum Training Level a character
may advance a given Skill to start with.



Maximum Starting Training Level


If a character were just starting out, and wanted to learn Cooking (a low cost
Skill with 1 EP Base Cost) and Armorer (a more difficult Skill with 4 EP Base
Cost), he could advance Cooking to a maximum Training Level of 10 (at a cost of
55 EP), and Armorer to a maximum Training Level of 4 (at a cost of 40 EP).




Species

Talents

In the DNet system, a character is defined by ten primary Talents.
These are described hereafter and have been split into two categories:
Mental and Physical.






Mental: Aura, Intelligence, Perception, Psyche, Willpower





Physical: Agility, Body, Manual Dexterity, Fitness, Strength






Human Talents are in the range -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5.
It should be noted that different player Species may have modifiers to some
Talents, thus moving them above or below the normal human range of -5 to +5.

Mental Talents
Aura (AUR)

Aura is the non-tangible complement to beauty. It represents a
character's ability to impress, influence, seduce, command and lead
people. Qualities such as natural charisma, personal magnetism, and
sex appeal are greatly influenced by a character's aura.


 
Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence encompasses memory, analytical and reasoning ability, and
speed of thought. A high Intelligence indicates a natural aptitude for
the generation, retention, and understanding of linear thought.


 
Perception (PER)

Perception includes alertness and observational acuity. A character with
a high Perception score has keen senses and is less likely to be surprised
by unexpected developments.


 
Psyche (PSY)

Psyche is the emotional counterpart to Intelligence. It rates a
character's ability to engage in creative, intuitive, spiritual and
transcendental thought. Amongst other things, Psyche enables interaction
with the supernatural, including the gods, the spirits of nature, and the
mysteries of the universe.


 
Willpower (WIL)

Willpower is an indicator of self discipline (determination and persistence)
and mental fortitude (resistance to influence, pain and stress).




Physical Talents
Agility (AGI)

Agility represents body control (static and motive) and connectivity.
It includes balance, rhythm, and flexibility.



Body (BOD)

Represents the amount of physical mistreatment that the character can
endure before his vital organs cease to function correctly, i.e. he 
falls unconscious or die. Generally, Body is proportional to the
character's size.



Manual Dexterity (DEX)

Manual Dexterity includes hand-eye coordination, fine motricity of the 
arms and hands, and sensitivity of touch.


 
Fitness (FIT)

Fitness is an indicator of bodily health (immune system) and metabolic 
efficiency. Running for two hours without halt is a good example of a 
Fitness related activity.


 
Strength (STR)

Strength is a rating of physical power, both in its instantaneous 
explosive expression and in its prolonged and measured form.




Strength Table

Use the following table to determine how much your character can carry and
lift based on its Strength. It is suggested that you record those numbers
on you character sheet for later use.

STR

Strength Talent.



Lift

The weight a character can lift overhead easily (in kg unless otherwise
indicated).



Load

The amount of weight a character can carry before he will feel the effects of
encumbrance (in kg unless otherwise indicated).



Load Step


Load Step = Load / 10




Humanoid Species

An example Species of a given Strength.





Generating Talents

There are two methods to generate Talents:
Buying with a point cost method or randomly rolling.


Buying Talents

A character begins with a number of Talent Points (TPs) divided evenly into
the two Talent categories, i.e. one half of the TPs must be spent on
Mental Talents and the other half on Physical Talents.



The number of starting TPs depends on the genre set by the GM:


Starting Talent Points




Highly Heroic20 TP
Average Talent = +2

Heroic10 TP
Average Talent = +1

Realistic0 TP
The adventurer is just as good as a normal human (Average Talent = 0)





The Talents are purchased at a cost equal to the Talent value.




For example, a Talent of +5 in Strength costs five TPs,
while a Talent of -2 would yield two TPs to be spent on other Talents.




A character cannot have a Talent over +5 or below -5 before the Species'
modifiers are applied.



Rolling for Talents

To generate values in the -5 to +5 range, the basic die roll method is to roll
2d6 then subtract 7 (i.e. 2d6-7). This methods gives a -5 to +5 distribution
that looks like a linear climbing ramp followed by a linear falling ramp, and
has a mean of 0. The odds of rolling each extreme (-5 or +5) are 1 chance out
of 36 for each roll. On ten rolls, the probability of having at least one +5
is about 25%.




Optional: 
A simple variant to the method presented above is to roll more dice than
needed and keep only the best. For example, one could roll 3d6 and keep only
the two best, ignoring the result of the lowest dice (this result is NOT
added). The use of this method is left to the discretion of the GM.




Once the die rolling method has been chosen (by the GM), several procedures can
be applied to generate a character's attributes. A few are:





Make a roll for each attribute in order.





Make ten rolls and assign the results to the attributes as you wish.





All talents start with zero as value. Make ten rolls, pool the total
and arrange points as you wish.





Make eleven or more rolls, drop the lowest and arrange to taste.





Talent Acquisition

Talent Acquisition Formula:




EP Cost = ([Desired Tal + 10] * [Desired Tal + 11] 
         - [Current Tal + 10] * [Current Tal + 11]) * 5 / 2



Talent Acquisition Cost

Gifts and Foibles

Gifts and Foibles cover anything not covered by Talents.
They have EP Costs, and may be bought with EPs when the character is created.



These are intended to cover special or unusual situations, like
"fire resistance" or "shape change." If the genre permits, psychological Gifts
or Foibles may also be permitted, such as "fear of snakes" or "high pain
threshold". EP Costs are assigned by the GM or genre.



Gifts and Foibles may be set out by the GM in advance, or made up on
the spot to allow good character conceptions.



Gift or Foible EP Costs will depend on how they actually affect
game play for the character. A guideline for assigning EP Costs is given below.



Note that this scheme is a guideline only. If the result is unsatisfactory,
the GM should alter it until it "feels" right. This scheme should just outline
the general range of EP Cost values.



The base cost is 5 EP for an Gift, or -5 for a Foible. This value
is then multiplied by 1 to 4, depending on whether the Gift or Foible
is slight, moderate, significant or extreme:



Gift/Foible is:                  Severity Multiplier
Normal:                          x 0
Mild/slight:                     x 1
Moderate:                        x 2
Rare/severe/significant:         x 3
Crippling/exceptional/extreme:   x 4



The value is also multiplied by a factor of 1/2 to 3, depending on whether the
Gift or Foible comes into play rarely, occasionally, often or all the time:



Gift/Foible:                    Frequency Multiplier
Rarely comes into play:         x 1/2
Occasionally comes into play:   x 1
Often comes into play:          x 2
Always comes into play:         x 3



Note that a single quality may involve a number of separate Gifts or
Foibles. Rather than trying to figure out a general sense of how
giftous the package is as a whole, each major aspect of the quality should
be defined and assigned EP Costs separately.




For example, a "vampire" might include:

Dies in contact with direct sunlight (always an extreme foible): -60
Dependent upon human blood (occasionally a significant foible): -15
Repelled by crosses and garlic (often a significant foible):  -30
Can shape-change into a bat (often an extreme gift):  40
...and so on.




It might seem obvious, but it is nonetheless important to state that any
Gift or Foible must be evaluated according to its effect in the
particular campaign. Having a fear of heights is worth no EP at all if the
entire campaign is to be conducted underground.



NOTE: All Gifts and Foibles that cause mental or physical alterations,
can be activated once per round, gives the character 1 Fatigue when activated,
and imobilizes the character for one round after the activation is done
(unless otherwise noted).
This is due to the extreme mental and physical strain.


Sample Gifts

Beauty +5 * Severity
  Beauty simply defines how good a character looks in terms of sheer 
  physical attractiveness, when regarded by one of his/her own Species. 
  It can be particularly important when you have no time to argue or 
  express yourself but must still leave a good impression. Gives a +1 
  bonus to Seduction and similar Skills per point of Effectiveness.

Ambidexterity +20

?Animal Empathy              +20

Regeneration (even limbs grow back)
   1 injury/rd   +200
   1 injury/min  +150
   1 injury/hour +100

   +100 if the regeneration brings the character back form death.

--- To be removed --------------------------------
-Healing/Regeneration        Variable
   Per INJURY point             +5 * Recovery Rate
      Recovery Rate
         per 5 hours            x2
         per hour              x10
         per minute           x600
	 per round           x6000
         per second         x36000
   Can replace limbs         +1000

(EP Cost = INJURY healed * 5 * Recovery Rate)
--------------------------------------------------

Nightvision (5 * 3 * 2) +30
   Unless there is complete darkness, the character can see as
   if it was midday on a cloudy day, but in shades of gray.

Infravision (5 * 2 * 2) +20
   Enables the character to "see" the heat emitted form the environment
   and other creatures.

Shape Change (5 * 4 * 2) +40
   The character can shift into one other shape.
   May be picked several times.

Innate Skill Bonus, ISB      ISB * (ISB + 1) * Skill's Base Cost / 2
   Ex: Climbing, ISB +3 = 3 * 4 * 3 / 2 = +18

Sense Aura (5 * 3 * 3) +45
   Characters with this gift are able to sense the "nature" of other beings.
   Upper planars will usually have bright/light auras and lower planars
   will usually have dark auras. The color and brightness reflects the
   creature's personality and motivation.

Invisibility (5 * 4 * 2) +40
   Turns the character and a thin layer of clothing invisible for as long as
   the character is mentaly aware. If the character falls unconscious or

   Ex: Flying 20 m/rd = +60 (+30 + 10 * 3)

Teleport +50 (+10 per additional 10 meters)
   A character with this ability can teleport 10 meters in any direction.
   The target area does not have to be seen, but it would sertenly make it
   safer. (GM's descretion).

Planeshift +100
   This can be quite dangerous. Before activating the ability, the character
   must be familiar with the target location to ensure safety. He must be
   able to somehow see or focus on the target location.

Telepathy
   One other person          +50   (+10 ?)
   All within same species  +500  (+100 ?)

   the person you're trying to communiate with.

Don't need sleep (find a better name) (+5 * 3 * 2) +30

Immortal +50

Careers

Choosing a Career does not limit a character to a certain set of Skills
exclusively, nor prevent a character from gaining Skills outside their Career
areas. The character will simply have more starting EPs in Skills within their
Career areas. There is nothing to prevent, for example, a Hunter character
from learning Skills from the Magic area at some later time, provided he has
the needed EP.



The percentile breakdown of the total EP gained in a particular Career is
listed after each Skill. The character will gain a total of 20 EP each month
the first five years of the Career. The next five years he gains a total of 10
EP each month. After these ten years he will gain a total of 5 EP each month.

Skills

A Skill is an acquired ability, one that a character learns.


Skill Competency

A Skill is composed of two parts:





Talent (Tal) (determined by the two Talents relevant to the Skill)



Training Level (Tr Lvl) (determined by experience with the Skill)





Skill = Avg(Tals) + Tr Lvl


Skill Competency





SkillCompetencyDescription


Tr = 0No Skill(A character who has no Training with a Skill.)
&lt;= 0Novice(A character who has Training but low Talent.)
1 - 5Apprentice(A character being taught a Skill.)
6 - 10Journeyman(A character who has learned his Skill.)
11 - 15Craftsman(A character who is proficient with his Skill.)
16 - 20Adept(A character who is an expert with his Skill.)
21 - 25Master(A character who is a master with his Skill.)
26+Grandmaster(A character who is legendary with his Skill.)





All skills confer the following abilities:





A character who has Tr &gt; 0 in a skill can recognize the use of that Skill by
another.





A character who has Tr &gt; 0 in a skill can recognize the Competency level of
another person with the same Skill.





A character can determine the actual Skill Level of another if the character's
Skill Level is greater than the other person's.






Skill Costs

All Skill costs are measured in EPs, also called Base Cost.
The higher BC, the harder the Skill is to learn and master.


Skill Cost




Skill DifficultyBC


Trivial1 EP
Easy2 EP
Average3 EP
Difficult4 EP
Very Difficut5 EP





Untrained Penalty

When a character attempts a Task for which he has not been Trained 
(Skill Competency is 'No Skill'), or to which no Skill is related,
he suffers an Untrained Penalty (UP).



Some Skills will have a special UP of Impossible. This indicates that
the Skill cannot be attempted when Skill Competency is 'No Skill'.




UP = 5





Optional:
The UP is generally equal to 5 but can be changed by the GM.
The GM may set a higher UP for a Task that is normally performed using a Skill
requiring a lot of knowledge or practice (Difficult and Very Difficult Skills).
In the same way, the GM may reduce or eliminate the UP for Tasks that are
primarily based on Talents (ex: holding one's breath), or that do not benefit
much from knowledge or practice (Trivial and Easy Skills).





As a guideline, a UP of twice the Base Cost of the related Skill is suggested
for Tasks that are normally performed using a Skill.






UP = 2 * BC





Bying Skills
Skill Acquisition

The following table can be used to look up the EP cost for advancing a Skill
from a Training Level of 0 to the desired Training Level in one step. This
table is most useful when creating a character and buying skills for the first
time.



Skill Acquisition Formula:




EP Cost = Desired Tr Lvl * (Desired Tr Lvl + 1) * BC / 2




Skill Acqusistion

If Argis the ranger wants to start his Tracking Skill (BC = 4 EP)
at Training Level 8, he must spend:

EP Cost = Desired Tr Lvl * (Desired Tr Lvl + 1) * BC / 2
        = 8 * 9 * 4 / 2 = 144 EP





For those who prefer not to use the formula, a table is provided.

Skill Advancement

To increase a Skill to its next Training Level, a character must spend a number
of EPs equal to the next Training Level times the Base Cost of the Skill.



Skill Advancement Formula:




EP Cost = Next Tr Lvl * BC




Skill Advancement

If Argis the ranger wants to increase his Tracking Skill (BC = 4 EP)
from Training Level 8 to Training Level 9, he must spend:

EP Cost = Next Tr Lvl * BC = 9 * 4 EP = 36 EP





For those who prefer not to use the formula, a table is provided.

Advancement Rules (Optional)


The methods presented below aim to better model the relations between Skill
use, Talents and Skill advancement. Some of them can be combined with the
standard method, while others replace it.



Training With Teacher


Teacher rolls:






Teaching Bonus = d10-d10* + Teachers Teaching Skill - Students Next Skill Level






Student rolls:






Students EP = (d10-d10* + Teaching Bonus + Students Avg(Tals, INT)
            - (5 * BC - 10)) / 5






Where Tals are the students Talents on the Skill he's
Training and INT is the students Intelligence.




Training With Teacher


Training With Teacher Example







Note: A teacher may not train a student to a higher Skill Level than that he
himself has in the Skill the student is Training, minus 1.




Teachers Training Limit


If Ronan wants to train his Tracking Skill to Skill Level 5,
he must find a Teacher with Tracking Skill Level of at least 6.






Training Without Teacher


Replace Teachers Teaching Skill with UP of the Teaching Skill:





GM rolls:






Teaching Bonus = d10-d10* + UP - Students Next Skill Level






Student rolls:






Students EP = (d10-d10* + Teaching Bonus + Students Avg(Tal,Adv,INT)
            - (5 * BC - 10)) / 5






Where Tals are the students Talents on the Skill he's
Training and INT is the students Intelligence.

the healer attempts to recover. Add 5 to TD for each attempt after the first
on the same character inside the same day.


Emergency Healing

Ronan sustains a 12 point wound;
Kara attempts to reduce it to a 9 point wound. TD will be 15.
If Ronan had been treated by Kara once already on that day,
TD would instead be 20.




Palliative healing enables natural healing to occur at the rate of 20% of
(BOD + 25) per day of low activity and 10% of (BOD + 25) per day of moderate
activity, provided the care-giver makes a Healing roll at TD 5 for each
patient under his care.



Medicine Skill can also be use to alleviate the effects of poisoning and to
diagnose and treat illnesses. A Healer who comes to the aid of a poisoned or
diseased individual can attempt to reduce the Virulence of the Affliction. The
Healer's TD for this action is 5 per point of Virulence the Healer attempts to
remove.


Healing Poisoning

Ronan drinks poison with a Virulence of 25;

Tasks

Task

A Task is a situation in which a character applies his abilities to
accomplish some action. A character may use his Talents or a Skill when
attempting to resolve the Task.


Task Difficulties

To aid the GM in determining TDs, the following TDs have been established
relative to what an average character (Tal = 0) with minimal Training in a Skill
(Tr Lvl = 1) can accomplish. Therefore, the values were derived from the
following Task Resolution Formula:




d10-d10* + 1 &gt;= TD




Thus, when assigning a difficulty to a Task, the GM should set the TD as if the
Task was being attempted by a Tal = 0, Tr Lvl = 1 character.
The GM should not base the difficulty on the Skill Level of the character
attempting the Task. In other words, figure out what the Task is like, then use
the table below to find the description that best fits the Task.
With this description, use the TD value listed.



Task Difficulties

Climbing a moss covered wall by someone with Tal = 0, Tr Lvl = 1
could be described as tricky. Tricky is listed under the "Could also be
described as" column for Difficult. The TD associated with a Difficult
Task is 5. Thus no matter what the Skill of a character attempting to
climb a moss covered wall, the Task Difficulty is 5.

If a character with Skill 3 in Climb Walls attempts to climb the moss
covered wall, he uses the formula: d10-d10* + 3 &gt;= 5.

If a character with Skill 10 in Climb Walls attempts to climb the moss
covered wall, he uses the formula: d10-d10* + 10 &gt;= 5.

*Odds are calculated for a Tal = 0, Tr Lvl = 1 character.


Task Resolution

The process of resolving a Task is called Task Resolution. It is done via a
roll of the dice. The applicable Skill is then added to the die roll and the
result must be greater than or equal to the TD set by the GM.



Thus the standard Task Resolution Formula is:




d10-d10* + Skill &gt;= TD




If situational modifiers reduce a Task Difficulty to 10 less than the Skill,
a Task Resolution roll is not required; the outcome is an automatic success.



Similarly, and especially in non-crisis situations, a GM may waive the
requirement for a task resolution roll when a character's skill rating is
5 points over the TD rating e.g., Skill 6, TD 1.


Task Resolution when No Skill is Used

If a character attempts a Task for which he does not possess a Skill or to
which no Skill is related, he uses (Avg(Tals) - UP) in place of Skill.



The Task Resolution Formula becomes:




d10-d10* + (Avg(Tals) - UP) &gt;= TD




where UP is the Untrained Penalty.



Note: Talent checks are conducted using this method, since they do not
involve a Skill. Because it is sometimes difficult to tell if a Task could
be done using a Skill or not, it is the responsibility of the GM to set an
UP of 0 for what he feels to be a true Talent check.



Task Resolution when No Skill is Used

An example of a true Talent check would be holding one's breath to which a
character's Fitness would be applied using the formula d10-d10* + FIT &gt;= TD.




Composite Task Resolution

There is a TD for the Task as a whole. A roll is made at an effective
Skill equal to the highest Skill minus one for each additional Skill which
are involved in the Task against that TD.



If the roll succeeds, the Task succeeds. If the roll fails, the Task fails.



Composite Task Resolution Formula:




d10-d10* + Skill - (N-1) &gt;= TD




where N is the number of Skills involved in the Task.


Contested Task Resolution

Contested Task Resolution Formula:




d10-d10* + Skill &gt;= TD + Opponent's Skill





Optional:
If a Contested Task is based on Talent only, i.e. it does not rely on the use
of a Skill, the GM may wish to double the value of each opponent's Talent,
to reflect the fact that the Task depends more on their raw capabilities than
on any form of experience.




Contested Task Resolution Based On Talents

A contest of Strength between Joe Blow and Conan could be resolved using:
d10-d10* + 2 * Joe Blow's STR &gt;= 2 * Conan's STR




Combining Efforts

When many characters unite their strength, intelligence, etc. to accomplish
a Task, they are often more efficient than if they were trying to
accomplish the Task independently. In such a situation, the success of the
attempted Task is obtained by having each character roll independently
against the TD. The TD is lowered by 1 for every character working on the Task
beyond the first.



The Task Resolution Formula for each character is therefore:




d10-d10* + Skill &gt;= TD - (N-1)




where N is the number of characters attempting the Task.



The Task is successful if at least one of the characters makes his roll.



The GM must decide, based on the Task, if more than one character can
attempt the Task. If he decides that more than one character can attempt 
the Task, he must then decide the maximum number of characters that can 
take part in attempting the Task.


Graded Outcome (Optional)


For GMs who prefer a slightly less absolute (success or failure) system of
determining the result of Task Resolution, the following system is provided
as an option for measuring the degree of success or failure.




Graded Outcome




Bonus  roll &gt;= TD + 10
SuccessTD &lt;= roll &lt;= TD + 9
PartialTD - 4 &lt;= roll &lt;= TD - 1
FailureTD - 9 &lt;= roll &lt;= TD - 5
Mishap roll &lt;= TD - 10





Bonus


A really good outcome which surpasses normal expectations.
If the GM cannot think of a reasonable Bonus then the outcome should simply be
treated as a Success.




Success


A successful outcome which achieves the desired result.




Partial


An outcome that could be categorized as somewhere between Success and Failure.
The exact result is left to GM discretion.




Failure


An unsuccessful outcome which does not achieve the desired result.




Mishap


A particularly bad failure that exposes the character to additional misfortune,
harm, penalty or confusion. If the GM cannot think of a reasonable Mishap then
the outcome should simply be treated as a Failure.





Graded Outcome


Shardra the Ranger has Tracking 4. She tries picking up the trail of a
wounded bandit. The GM decides that this will be hard, as it's been raining.
The Task Resolution formula becomes:

d10-d10* + 4 &gt;= 5

If Shardra's player's total roll is 15 or higher, a Bonus, not only does
Shardra pick up the trail, she also picks up the overlying trail of a
pursuing wolverine.

If she rolls 5 to 14, a Success, Shardra picks up the bandit's trail.

If she rolls 1 to 4, a Partial, Shardra only picks up enough of the trail
to determine the general direction taken by the bandit.

If she rolls -4 to 0, a Failure, Shardra is unable to pick up the trail
because it has been washed away.

If she rolls a -5 or less, a Mishap, Shardra picks up the wrong trail that
leads her in a totally different direction.








General Rules

Encumbrance

The Load that each character can carry without ill effects varies with his
Strength and is given in the Strength table. When a character is loaded with
more weight than his Strength allows, his Fatigue rises faster than if he
was normally loaded.



The additional Fatigue that a character suffers when he is heavily loaded is
equal to the Encumbrance Penalty, which is calculated from the Load and Load
Step values of the Strength table. When the carried weight is lower than or
equal to the character's allowed Load, then the Encumbrance Penalty is equal
to 0. When the weight carried is greater than this Load, the Encumbrance
Penalty is increased by one for every increment of weight equal to Load Step
(or fraction of Load Step).




Encumbrance Penalty = (Weight-Load) / Load Step (round up)



Encumbrance Penalty

A character with STR = 2 can normally carry 35 kg and has a Load Step of 3.5 kg.
If the character chooses to carry 40 kg, i.e. he carries 5 kg more than allowed,
he faces an Encumbrance Penalty of 2.

Encumbrance Penalty = (40 kg - 35 kg) / 3.5 kg
                    = 5 kg / 3.5 kg
                    = 1.43            
                    = 2 (rounded up)

Each time this character will increase his Fatigue Heap, he will increase it
by 3 (1 plus the Encumbrance Penalty). See the Fatigue rules for more details.




The Encumbrance rules only takes into account the mass of items, not their
bulkiness. As always, a GM may state that the character suffers an additional
penalty on his Skill checks because he is loaded with large items.
For example, a GM has the right to impose a penalty of 10 on all Skill checks
to a character who is carrying a canoe, even if the character has the Strength
to do it. This is left to each GM, as we feel that such situations are not very
common and that threating them here would just add unnecessary complexity to
the rules.




Optional: The GM can decide that the Encumbrance Penalty is also applied on
some or all Skills checks in addition to contributing to Fatigue;
he can also decide that Encumbrance only affects Skill checks if the Fatigue
rules are not used. When the Encumbrance Penalty is applied on a Skill check,
the TD is increased by the value of the Encumbrance Penalty.



Skill Check With Encumbrance Penalty


If the character from the example above wants to jump over a 1.5 meters fence
while carrying 40 kg, the GM can decide to apply the Encumbrance Penalty on the
Skill check:

d10-d10* + Jumping Skill &gt;= TD + Fatigue + Encumbrance Penalty




Falling

A character falling on hard ground suffers 1d6 points of Damage for each
2 meters of his fall. This Damage is not reduced by Armor Resistance.


Fatigue
Efforts

Each time a character performs an action, he accumulates Fatigue, be it mental
or physical. This accumulated Fatigue makes it harder for him to perform
subsequent actions. At some point, he is too Fatigued to do anything correctly
and has to rest. (For simplicity, both mental and physical fatigue are
encompassed by the Fatigue Heap).



Some Skills will tire a character faster than others.


Efforts

Reading is less draining that moving 10 kg rocks to build a wall.
Thus, the person moving rocks will get tired much faster than the person who
is reading.




To take this into account, each character has a Fatigue Heap, which is
initially at 0 when he is fully rested and which increases as the character
performs various activities. The more exacting these activities are, the
faster the Fatigue Heap increases.


Fatigue Rating

Taking a second look at our above example, we could qualify reading as a light
Effort, while moving rocks would be a moderate Effort. The character moving
rocks would thus have to increase is Fatigue every 15 minutes, while the one
reading would only increase it every hour (see the table below).




The Fatigue Heap is always increased by 1 plus the Encumbrance Penalty (see
the Encumbrance rules) each time it is augmented, no matter which
activity is performed. The frequency at which the Fatigue Heap is increased
depends on the effort required by the Skill or activity. In the case of
Skills, one or more Fatigue Ratings will be associated with various uses of
the Skill, which makes it easy to find the Fatigue increment frequency. For
movement, this frequency depends on the movement speed (see the movement rules).
As usual, the GM can always change the frequency at which Fatigue is increased.



While many Skills will have one or Fatigue Ratings associated with them, the
GM will often have to determine how wearing a Task is. In that case, we
recommend that the GM describes the effort required in words and then
associates this effort with the appropriate frequency for increasing Fatigue.




For example, a Task that requires a moderate-heavy effort would require to
increase the Fatigue Heap every 4 minutes.

Note: the Fatigue rules are optional for most Skill checks but is recommended
for the magic and movement rules. In the magic rules, Fatigue limits the
number of Spells that can be cast, while in the movement rules it limits the
distance that can be covered.




Recuperation

A resting character recovers one Fatigue point every 15 minutes. A sleeping
character recovers one Fatigue point every 8 minutes (or two every 15
minutes). Samples activities that can be considered as resting are: talking,
eating, sitting, meditating, ... Of course, the character must not perform
another activity at the same time.

             = d10-d10* + 10 + 3   - 10
             = d10-d10* + 3




Lift

The maximum weight that a character can lift easily is given by the Lift value
from the Strength table. When Lifting weight, the following equation is used:




d10-d10* &gt;= Lift TD [+ Fatigue]




Lift





ActionLift TDFatigue Rating


Lift just above ground-15(8)

For every increase in weight equal to Load Step, increase TD by 1.



For every decrease in weight equal to Load Step, decrease TD by 1.



Final Lift TD Formula:




Final Lift TD = Lift TD + ( (Weight - Lift) / Load Step )



Load

The amount of weight a character can carry before he will feel the effects of
Encumbrance (in kg unless otherwise indicated).



When a character carries a weight equal to or lower than Load, his Encumbrance
Penalty is equal to 0. If the weight carried is greater than Load, then the
Encumbrance Penalty is increase by 1 for every increase of weigth equal to the
Load Step (or a fraction of the Load Step).




Load Step = Load / 10




Load Formula (round up):




Encumbrance Penalty = (Weight - Load) / Load Step




Load

STR = 0; Load = 20 kg; Load Step = 2 kg

Weight &lt;= 20kg   -&gt; Encumbrance Penalty = 0
Weight = 20.5 kg -&gt; Encumbrance Penalty = 1
Weight = 22 kg   -&gt; Encumbrance Penalty = 1
Weight = 22.5 kg -&gt; Encumbrance Penalty = 2
Weight = 24 kg   -&gt; Encumbrance Penalty = 2
Weight = 35 kg   -&gt; Encumbrance Penalty = (35 - 20) / 2 = 8




Movement

There are five basic speeds for characters movement. The Base speed is a
very slow walk, the Walking speed is a good long distance pace and the
Running speed is a normal jogging. The Sprinting speed is the highest speed
at which most characters can go and the Max speed is the absolute
maximum speed at which a member of a given Species can go (for humans, the
maximum speed is that of olympic sprinters).



Movement









Human

Base35-51/hour
Walking610-51/hour
Running1220-54/hour
Sprinting*2440-51/10 rounds
Max**3660151/round






Characters have to make movement checks periodically to continue moving at
the same speed. The TD is increased before making the movement check.



* For speeds below the sprinting speed, the check is made using the Endurance
skill:




d10-d10* + Endurance &gt;= Movement TD




** For speed at or over the sprinting speed, the check is made using the
Sprinting skill:




d10-d10* + Sprinting &gt;= Movement TD




If a character fails a check, he must slow down. If he was Running he starts
Walking, if he was Sprinting he goes down to Running, ...
The TD of the movement check remains the same (except if the character goes
from Max speed to Sprinting, in which case the TD is reduced by 10).



When the character wants to move at the Max speed, he must make an initial
movement check. Failure indicates that he can move at most at the Sprinting
speed. The TD is not increased before this initial check.



The GM is free to change the period at which the checks are made, converting
the TD increase appropriately (Sprinting could require one check per 15
minutes, with a TD increase of 1). See Advanced Movement for more complete
movement rules.


Movement Skills

For movement slower than Sprinting, players should use the Endurance Skill
in the movement check, or Fitness if their character does not possess the
Endurance Skill. For movement at or above the Sprinting speed, players should
use the Sprinting Skill or Strength in the movement check.



If a character does not have a Training in either Endurance or Sprinting, he
does not face an Untrained Penalty (UP = 0). These Skills are considered to be
common enough that everyone has a basic Training in them.



Chases

If a Chase takes place in a crowded environment, the participants must make
an additional Agility check every round. This check is made against the current
movement TD:




d10-d10* + AGI &gt;= Movement TD




Each participant that passes the check can move at the full Sprinting speed
or over, otherwise he can only move at the Running speed or less. Of course,
if the character attempts to go over the Sprinting speed, he must have
passed a movement check before he can make the Agility check.



If the graded outcomes system is used, a Partial indicates that the
participant moves a bit slower than Sprinting (generally Sprinting minus
Base, but the GM can change this). A Mishap indicates that he has tripped,
or any other unfortunate event that the GM can devise, while a Bonus allows
him to cover an extra distance equal to his Base speed.



If the Chase occurs on clear and level ground, the same method can be used
except that Agility is replaced by Strength in the check...



Advanced Movement (Optional)


The movement rules detailed below attempt to cover in a sensible manner most
game situations where movement plays a critical part. However, they might be
cumbersome in situations where movement is not critical and the GM is free to
use them when and as he wishes. It is only suggested that he employs the
standard movement speeds (Base, Walking, Running, Sprinting and Max).



Movement Speeds


Movement speeds are divided in five broad categories: Base, Walking, Running,
Sprinting and Max.





The Base movement speed is the reference from which the four others are
calculated. The speed of a character in a melee combat situation is also equal
to the Base speed (see Movement and Distances in Combat).





The Walking speed is equal to a good but sustainable walking pace, the Running
speed is a moderate jogging and the Sprinting speed is a hurried run. For
comparison purposes, olympic marathoneers runners move at a pace between
Running and Sprinting (~ 19 km/h) and the Max movement speed listed is
that of the olympic sprinters (100 meters in 10 seconds).





In order to simplify the rules, it is considered that all members of a Species
can sustain the speeds given in the table below, for a short period of time
(until their first movement check).

Max**366012 * Base(10)

**: 100 meters in 10 secs




Movement Checks


A character must do periodic movement checks to see if he can continue to
move at a given speed despite the accumulated Fatigue. The checks are
done using:





d10-d10* + Movement Skill &gt;= Movement TD + Fatigue





At the end of each movement period, the character's Fatigue Heap must be
increased by one plus his Encumbrance Penalty. The check is made after Fatigue
has been increased. The Skill that is used in the check depends on the speed
at which the character goes (see Movement Skills).





If the character's roll added to his Movement Skill is greater than his
accumulated Fatigue plus the Movement TD, then the character can continue
moving at the same speed. If not, then the character must slow down by his Base
speed (a human Running at 12 km/h would slow down by 3 km/h and would thus end
up at 9 km/h). A character can accelerate at any time, as long as he has been
successful in his last movement check.





Note that Fatigue is necessary for the movement rules, even if it is not used
in other parts of the rules. Using Fatigue with the movement rules gives
pretty realistic results.





While the base TD is -5 up to the Sprinting speed, the frequency of the checks
changes with the movement rate.



Fatigue Frequency Check


A character needs to check only once per hour when Walking but
must make a check every minute when Sprinting.






The faster the character goes, the faster he gets Fatigued.




Activity vs Check Frequency

3 rounds10 * Base(9)
1 round11 * Base or more(10)







Basically, the frequency of the checks double each time the movement speed
increases by the Base speed.





A character can always start to Walk, Run or Sprint without a check, as long
as he doesn't try to go over the standard Sprinting speed (see Heavy Sprinting)
or does not suffer from heavy Fatigue. If the GM judges that a character is too
tired to move, he can require a movement check before the character starts to
move (no Fatigue is added to the Fatigue Heap before making this check). If the
check passes, then the character moves normally. If the check fails, then the
GM can either impose a maximum speed for the character or require that the
character rests before starting to move. In the later case, the character can
attempt to move as soon as his Fatigue Heap has been reduced by one point or
more.



Marathon Runner


A human runner wants to finish a marathon in about 2 hour and 10 minutes. To
cover the 42 km in 130 minutes, he needs to go at about 19 km/h, which is
approximately equal to 6 times the Base speed of 3 km/h. He will thus have to
make a movement check every 4 minutes. (Note: running a marathon in 2h10min is
a world class performance.)

Our marathon runner has an Endurance Skill of 30.
After 4 minutes of running, his Fatigue Heap is increased by one and he has to
make a first movement check:

d10-d10* + Endurance &gt;= -5 + Fatigue
d10-d10* + 30        &gt;= -5 + 1

It is quite obvious that he has virtually no chance of failing this check.
In fact, he is almost certain of being successful in the first 25 checks
(unless he rolls a fumble). This well trained runner can thus run at 19 km/h
for 100 minutes (25 checks * 4 minutes/check) without any major problem.
It only starts getting difficult for him in the last 30 minutes, when he has to
give his last energies to maintain the same rhythm.






If a similar situation occurs in a game, it is strongly suggested that the
GM does not require the players to roll for checks that are always successful
unless the character fumbles. The players should not have to roll as long as
their Skill is 10 points higher than the TD.






For our marathon runner, this means that we need to roll only the last seven
check.

The first of these check is:

d10-d10* + 30 &gt;= -5 + 26

while the seventh is:

d10-d10* + 30 &gt;= -5 + 32

If he makes these seven movement checks successfully, he will have completed
the marathon in 2 hours and 10 minutes!





Heavy Sprinting


The Sprinting speed given in the movement Speed table is the speed that all
members of a Species can sustain for a short period of time (1 minute). If
a characters wants to go faster than the standard Sprinting speed, he faces
a greater difficulty than just having to make more frequent checks. For each
increment of speed equal to the Base speed, 5 is added to the TD.



Sprinting


Thus, to run 100 meters in 10 seconds, a character would need to go at 
60 meters/round, which means an increase of 20 of the TD.
In addition, the character needs to make a movement check every round.

The check that a human needs to make to run 100 meters in 10 seconds is:

d10-d10* + Sprinting &gt;= 15 + Fatigue






When a character wants to move at a speed greater than the standard Sprinting
speed, he also needs to make an initial movement check. No fatigue is added
to the Fatigue Heap before making this check (Fatigue is always added at the
end of the movement period).





If a character tries to move faster than the Sprinting speed but fails his
check, the maximum speed that he can reach is obtained by substracting Fatigue
from his total roll and comparing the result with the movement TD in the table
below. The maximum speed that he can reach corresponds to the maximum movement
TD that is smaller than or equal to his adjusted roll.







If a sprinter rolls a total 6 on his movement check and has a Fatigue of 3,
then his adjusted roll is 3 and he can reach a maximum speed of 9 times the
Base speed (45 meters/round for a human).







The maximum speed that a character can reach is equal to 12 times the Base
speed. For a human, this speed is equal to 60 meters/round, which is equivalent
to running 100 meters in 10 seconds, a feat that only olympic athletes can
achieve. Of course, the GM is free to remove this limitation on maximum speed.

Sprinting


An olympic athlete with a Sprinting Skill of 25 is on the starting line for the
100 meters race. As he is fully rested, his Fatigue is initially equal to 0.
Upon hearing the gun, he jumps from the starting blocks.

An initial movement check is made:

d10-d10* + Sprinting &gt;= Movement TD + Fatigue
d10-d10* + 25        &gt;= -5 + 20     + 0
-2       + 25        &gt;= 15
23                   &gt;= 15          -&gt; success

This initial movement check is successful and the character is thus moving at
60 meters per round. However, since his speed is equal to 12 times the Base
speed, he must make a check every round. He will thus have to make another
check after one round (6 seconds) of running. His Fatigue Heap is increased by
1 due to the first round of Sprinting and his second movement check is:

d10-d10* + Sprinting &gt;= Movement TD + Fatigue
d10-d10* + 25        &gt;= -5 + 20     + 1
3        + 25        &gt;= 16
28                   &gt;= 16          -&gt; success

This second check is also successful and the sprinter makes it to the finish
line in 10 seconds!









Combat

Introduction


"... violence is the last refuge of the incompetent."

-- Isaac Asimov



When other means of achieving objectives have failed, the party of adventuring
characters may find themselves in an encounter that leads to combat. Combat
can take many forms including melee, archery, arcane, etc.  Good combat
rules should cover all those situations, while being simple enough not to
prevent the players from having fun.



Like everything else in the DNet system, combat rules seek to achieve a
balance between realism, simplicity and heroism. In a completely realistic
system, serious wounds often prove fatal and the GM has to take great care not
to create a situation where combat is unavoidable. At the opposite,
in a heroic system where the characters can endure extreme wounds without
flinching, combat often becomes the preferred mean to resolve situations of
conflict. In our vision, combat should not limit character development by
ending it whenever it happens, nor should it prevent it by being a universal
solution to all problems. Therefore, the DNet combat system is deadly
enough that characters won't always seek combat as the solution to their
problems, but not so deadly as to make the characters flee each time brute
force is required.


Basic Premises
Combat Styles

There is more to combat than just swinging a weapon; most of the reflexes that
make a good fighter have more to do with the way he uses his weapon than with
the particular weapon used. The Skills your character has to learn to be a
proficient fighter are thus named Combat Styles. The primary style for a
fighter with military training would probably be "One-Handed Weapons &amp;
Shield".
A northern barbarian wielding a claymore would most often use the "Two-Handed
Weapon" style. A magic oriented character would probably opt for a low cost
style such as "Staves", giving him basic combat abilities while letting him
focus most of his efforts on magic lore.



As your character gains experience, he can advance in one or more Combat
Style. Since Combat Styles are used for both attack and defense, improving
them makes you both harder to hit and better at hitting your opponents.



The Combat Round

As in many RPG systems, combat in DNet is resolved by dividing its duration
into rounds. During a round, each character can perform one action:
attacking an opponent, casting a spell, reloading a bow, etc. Each combat round
represents six seconds of action, giving ten rounds per minute.



During a combat round, each protagonist will get to accomplish one action,
without consideration for who acts first or last. Each attack/defense
confrontation is in fact an exchange of blows and the damage inflicted by the
protagonists upon each other is the summation of the effects of each
individual blow. It is therefore perfectly possible for two combatants to
finish off each other in the same round, giving a situation similar to the
final combat scene in the movie "Excalibur".



Combat Round Sequence

Most gamers hate it when the mechanics of combat system take more time than
the actions and tactical decisions of the characters. In other words, the
mechanics should not slow down the combat flow and bring down the climactic
tension. The combat round sequence outlined here and described more fully
later in the text will generally be most effective one for smooth combat
resolution.



The combat round begins with the declaration phase, during which each player
announces the actions of his character(s) and the GM states the actions of the
NPCs. The order of the declaration can be arbitrary or determined by rolling
for initiative. In both cases, it is advantageous to declare last, since you
can decide the actions of your character in regard of what others have
announced.



After all actions have been declared, the resolution phase begins.
No particular order is required, as all actions are considered to be
simultaneous and every character is assured that he will have a chance to
attempt its planned actions. For attacks, resolution is divided in two
steps: the attacker first attempts to hit the defender in a contest of
Skills; if he is succesful, Damage is calculated using the procedure outline
above.



At the end of each combat round, after all actions have been resolved,
characters that have been wounded during the round must check to see if they
remain conscious and alive.



Impact, Damage and Injury

When you hit an opponent with a weapon, you generally intend to cause him some
physical damage. The DNet system uses a specific procedure with its
associated terminology to calculate this damage; the basics of the damage
calculation procedure are exposed here, so that you can better understand
the rest of the system. The complete procedure will be described in detail
later in the combat chapter.



Every physical attack is said to cause an Impact.



Impact, Damage And Injury

A hit with bastard sword made by an average human causes 2d6+5 points of Impact.
If the target is wearing armor, part of the attack's Impact is absorbed by the
armor, while the remaining part, if any, constitutes the true physical Damage,
which is added to the target's Injury Heap.
If the target suffers too much Injury, i.e. more than what is Body allows,
he will pass out and eventually die.





Combat Styles

One of the fundamental premises behind the DNet combat system is that one's
fighting style is more important than the actual weapon used. A fighter used
to fighting with a broad sword and a shield will find it much easier to fight
with a bastard sword and a shield than to fight with a broad sword alone. His
combat reflexes are tuned to certain strike sequences relying on the shield
to parry blows. For him, fighting without the shield means developping new
strike sequences, something that is not always easy to do in the middle of
a melee.

Special Characteristics




Range


Close (0 - 1 m; actually engaged in close combat)
Near (1 - 10 m; engaged or able to move to engage this round)
Moderate (11 - 50 m; not in melee range, but probably in missile weapon range)
Far (51 - 100 m; not in melee range, but probably in missile weapon range)
Extreme (&gt; 100 m; out of all but the longest range missile weapons)




2nd rank

Extended weapon reach to attack opponents from a distance, as from behind a
line of friendly shield bearers.



Fend

Basically Fend keeps opponent with shorter weapon at a distance unable to
attack. Opponent who loses against Fend either cannot attack or takes automatic
hit at full Damage (maximum for thrusting weapon and STR bonus).




A Fend can be started if an opponent is outside of Close range at the start of
a combat round. Otherwise, a successful Fend means that an opponent who is at
Close range is unable to attack in the next round. A successful Fend must occur
in each subsequent round to keep the opponent at bay.


Entangle

Entangle limbs. A successful attack will entangle the limbs of the
defender, unless an Agility check against a TD equal to the attacker's total
roll is made by the defender. The attacker must specify that he is trying
to entangle during the declaration phase.



Trip

Entangle legs and trip opponent. A successful attack will entangle the
legs of the defender, unless an Agility check against a TD equal to the
attacker's total roll is made by the defender. The attacker must specify
that he is trying to trip during the declaration phase.



Shield Bonus

The use of a shield gives a bonus to defense of 2 plus the shield bonus, 
which depends on the type of shield.





Optional: Instead of the fixed +2 defense bonus, the Shield Use skill
gives a +1 bonus for every 5 levels, i.e. +1 at levels 1 through 5, 
+2 at levels 6 through 10, +3 at levels 11 through 15, ...



Shield Bash

The ability to use shield as a weapon. Blow causes 2d6 + shield Impact +
1 point per Sise Rating of the attacker + Strength of the attacker.
Defender is knocked off his feet and goes prone unless a successful Agility
check against a TD equal to the attacker's total roll is made.



Def Fencing/Close only

Defense against Fencing and Close styles only.



Hand

Attacks with hands or fists do 2d6-8 Impact.



Foot

Kicking attacks to 2d6-6 Impact.



Bash

Bashing attacks include body slams and tackles. Impact is 2d6-4.
A running start is required to do Damage, so no Impact is done if you are
already at Close range. (possible to force backwards even if starting at Close
range)



Throw

Throws include leg sweeps and judo/wrestling throws. IMPACT is 2d6-6 and
is not modified by STR. Success leaves the defender prone.



Hold

Hold attacks include judo holds and wrestling pins.  
After a successful attack the defender must make a roll if he wants to
try to break the hold.  





d10-d10* + STR + skill &gt;= holder's STR + skill




The "skill" may be from any style which includes "hold" attacks.
If the hold is successful, the attacker may choose to inflict damage: 




Impact is 2d6-4 (+STR).




* Note about HANDS: There are holds and throws which require two hands,
and some which require no hands. The GM may judge if a maneuver is possible
or more difficult (skill penalty) in some situations, such as if the player has
his hands bound.


Long Range Styles
Archery

Any (non-cross) bow. Rate of Fire (ROF) is generally one arrow per round.



Cross Bows

All crossbows. ROF will be determined by weapon and Strength. High Strength
crossbow weapons may only allow occasional fire 1/3 rounds to 1/10 rounds.
If there is a 1/1 rate of fire, damage is minimal e.g. per dagger.



Thrown Weapons

Any weapon which can be thrown. Effectiveness is greatly limited with weapons
that were not designed to be thrown. Weapons designed to be thrown -- axe,
knives, boomerang, darts, javelin, discus, etc.
ROF is 1 per round if the weapon is appropriately carried on the body
(at girdle or similar -- not in pack). When throwing into a melee situation,
ROF is reduced to 1/2 rounds or roll randomly for target.




Melee Styles
Articulated Weapons

Any articulated weapon. Leveraged weapons (like a flail) are harder to use than
a more straightforward weapon. This covers all such weapons, one or two handed,
when used without a shield. If a shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied
to the Skill.



Articulated Weapons &amp; Shield

Any one handed articulated weapon used with a shield.
Leveraged weapons (like a flail) are harder to use than a more
straightforward weapon. This covers all such one handed weapons, when used
with a shield. If no shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the 
skill.


  
Bolas/Whips/Ropes/Nets

Bolas, whips, ropes and nets.



Close Weapons

Weapons such as knives, daggers, brass knuckles, etc.
Opponents must be at Close range. If not they can Fend. If a shield is used,
a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.



Close Weapons &amp; Shield

Weapons such as knives, daggers, brass knuckles, etc.
Opponents must be at Close range. If not they can Fend. If no 
shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.



Dual Weapon

Any 2 weapons which can be wielded with one hand.
Comments: minus on defense, or limit defense as in previous post. (i.e.
can not defend against weapons more than one `class' larger than secondary
weapon without loosing attack. Limit weapons to those smaller than medium
with respect to character size/strength.



Fencing

Fencing defense can only occur against Fencing and Close Weapons.
Against other Styles, reduce Def to 1.
Parry repost style fighting with light weight weapons -- edge or point attacks.
This is not for unbalanced weapons like axe or mace.



One-handed Weapons

Any non-articulated weapon which can be wielded with one hand.
If a shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.



One-Handed Weapons &amp; Shield

Any non-articulated weapon which can be wielded with one hand.
If no shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.



Polearms

Halbards, poles with ax, blade, pick, or exotic ends of reach 2 to 2.5.
Pole arms are commonly swung, having blade or pick. They have a
higher moment of inertia than Two-Handed Weapons. They also have some closer
grip style that allows some parry action with the either end ala quarter
staff. Most wielders of pole arms do not like to use that style, prefering
to use weapon from 2nd rank. If the weapon has a spear point, it may also
be used in Thrusting Weapons Style.



Staves

All staves.



Thrusting Weapons

Any spear weapon. Includes pike which is a reach 3 spear.
This to cover spears and such. Thrusting style does not use nether end for
block, but forward shaft. Thrusting Style also includes Fend as an alternative
to attack and defend.
If a shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.



Thrusting Weapons &amp; Shield

Any one-handed spear weapon. Includes pike which is a reach 3 spear.
(*pike is one-handed?)
This to cover spears and such. This includes shield use for smaller shields.
Thrusting weapon may be one handed with shield. Thrusting Style does not use
nether end for block, but forward shaft. Thrusting Style also includes Fend as
an alternative to attack and defend.
If no shield is used, a penalty of -5 is applied to the Skill.



Two-Handed Weapons

Any non-articulated weapon which can be wielded with two hands.




Unarmed Styles

I would like to use a minimal list of unarmed combat styles, since it is
more in the spirit of the current weapon styles. A well rounded martial
artist using this list would learn Karate for the hand and foot maneuvers,
Close Weapons for the usual list of Chinese peasant weapons, Judo for
the throws, Staff, and One-Handed Weapon skills.


Boxing

No defence vs weapons. Hand, brass knuckles.
Boxing-ring, or bare-fist style fighting.



Brawling

-5 defence vs weapons. Hand, bash. Barroom brawl style.



Karate

-3 defence vs weapons. Hand, foot.
Generic style for basic Eastern martial arts.
We may want to limit weapon defences for Brawling and Karate for small
and maybe medium size weapons.



Judo/Wrestling

No defence vs weapons. Hold, throw.
Generic style for Western-style wrestling and Eastern-style Judo.

Catch Missiles

Gives the character a chance to catch missiles, but only if the player says he
will try to do so in the declaration phase. The task difficulties (TD) for the
various kind of missiles are given below:




Catch Missiles TD

Disarm

This Skill is used in place of a normal attack to attempt to disarm an
opponent. The success check is:





d10-d10* + Attakers SA + Attakers STR &gt;= d10-d10* + Defeders SD + Defenders STR




This Skill can be used by both armed and unarmed combatants. Some Combat
Styles may have modifiers that are added to your roll when you attempt
to disarm an opponent.




Optional: Both opponents can add the mass of their weapon (rounded to the
nearest kilogram) to their roll.



Dodge

The Dodge Skill allows the character to attempt to escape blows
from two opponents for each Dodge action. It can be used in conjunction with
the Style attack/defenses using the multiple actions mechanism.




For example,
if a fighter wants to attack one opponent and Dodge two others, the Style 
actions (attack and defense) and the Dodge action (evading the blows from the
two other opponents) will be rolled with a -5 penalty. If the Dodge Skill is
used in conjunction with a shield, the bearer can add the shield bonus to his
defense roll.


Evade Missiles

Allows character to dodge incoming missiles. The player must declare that the
character will try to do so during the declaration phase. Task difficulties
are:

Combat Sequence

This section explains in detail how combat is resolved in the DNet
system. To this end, a game situation leading to combat is developped as the
rules are presented.



Combat is broken down into rounds. Each round is considered to last 6
seconds. All actions that occur within a round are independent of each other
and are considered to take place at the same time.  Thus it is always possible
for two combatants to strike each other down in the same round.



Within a combat round, attacks and defenses are viewed as a passe d'armes, not
as individual strokes.


Combat

Game situation: Neila and Jalik have been cautiously exploring the ruins
  of a temple of Hekari, an almost forgotten deity of darkness and disease,
  in the hope of lifting a curse that as been plaguing a pixie community
  for centuries. As they are about to despair, their efforts are rewarded
  by a hollow sound from a flagstone reveals a hidden passage. After
  doublechecking their torches and pushing the stone safely aside, they
  engage in the the shadows of a stairway.

The characteristics and appropriate skills and equipment of the two characters
are given here for reference purposes.

Neila (Bob's character)
Mental Talents:   AUR: 0; INT: 1; PER: 0;  PSY: 1; WIL: 2
Physical Talents: AGI: 2; BOD: 2; DEX: -2; FIT: 1; STR: 3
Combat Styles:
                          Tals + Tr = Skill
  One Handed W. &amp; Shield:   0  + 8  = 8      Attack: 8  Defense: 8+2+4 = 14
  Dodge:                    2  + 7  = 9      Defense: 9+4 = 13
Equipment:
  War Hammer (Impact = 2d6+4)
  Kite (defense bonus = 4)
  Soft leather bezainted armor (Resistance = 6)

Jalik (Roger's character)
Mental Talents:   AUR: 1; INT: 1; PER: 2; PSY: 0; WIL: 0
Physical Talents: AGI: 3; BOD: 1; DEX: 2; FIT: 0; STR: 0
Combat Styles:
                Ta + Tr = Skill
  Dual Weapons: 3  + 6  = 9      Attack: 9+2 = 11  Defense: 9-1 = 8
  Dodge:        3  + 5  = 8
Equipment:
  2 small swords (Impact = 2d6+2)
  a 2 meters wooden pole
  Quilt armor (Resistance = 3)



Declaration

At the beginning of every combat round, the GM must ask every player to declare
the actions of his character for the round. The GM must also state the actions
of all NPCs and monsters during that phase. Once stated, these actions cannot
be changed, unless the GM feels that there has been a misunderstanding; in that
case, every player should be allowed to redeclare the actions of his character.



The declaration order does not really matter as long as the actions of all
protagonists are stated. A fixed order, such as going around the table will
generally speed game play.



Note that a character can attack multiple targets only if he is in close range
(0 to 1 meters) of both targets at declaration time.



Declaration

Game situation: Jalik and Neila reach the bottom of the stairs about 5 meters 
  below the ground level.
  GM: In the torchlight, you can see that the floor is littered with
    bones.
  Roger: "[Whisper] Cover me." I slowly crouch to inspect the bones.
  GM: They look like humanoid bones, generally human sized.
  Roger: I inspect the walls, looking for holes or any trace of a mechanism.
  GM: You spend 5 minutes doing as careful an inspection you can
    without stepping on the floor. The walls are plain and smooth. You don't
    see any obvious crevasse.
  Roger: I slowly pass the wooden pole along the floor and the walls.
  GM: (rolling a few dice to make good impression) Nothing happens.
  Bob: "[Whisper] It looks ok?"
  Roger: "[Whisper] Yes... I go first, you follow me 4 steps behind."
    I advance in the passage, tell me when I notice anything different.
  GM: After 4 meters, the floor is clear of bones. The transition
    is gradual.
  Roger: I continue.
  Bob: I still follow about 2 meters behind.
  GM: You walk two more steps and hear a concert of clicking sounds
    as the bone quickly move along the floor to reassemble into three distinct
    shapes. Two of the shapes are near Neila, while the third is behind 
    Jalik's back. What do you do?
  Bob: "[Loud] Watch your back!". Neila attacks the nearest shape and will 
    dodge the two others if necessary.
  Roger: Jalik drops his pole and takes out his two swords. He will also
    attack the nearest shape.
  GM: Jalik's attack won't happen until next round, but they won't
    be able to attack this round either. Neila, you realize that you can 
    bash at the nearest one without worrying about dodging the other.




Initiative (Optional)


Some role players find that basing the declaration order on the Talents of
their characters allow for more strategy during combat. A declaration method
which allow the characters with the best Perception to react to the actions
of others is presented here.




Determining initiative:



Roll 1d10
Add Perception (you may get negative results)




Actions are then declared starting with the lowest initiative roll to the
highest. This gives a chance to characters with the highest Perception to
adjust their actions to those of others.





All players should roll for initiative and the GM should also roll it for NPCs
and monsters. In large combats, the GM may wish to roll initiative for groups
of monsters or even for all monsters at the same time.




Alternate Initiative (Optional)


Another method to determen initiativ is to base the characters reactions on the
speed of their weapon and their Agility Talent. The more agile characters will
act faster than those less agile.




Roll d3 (d6 if surprised)
Add Weapon Speed (WS)
Subtract Agility




Also with this mechanism actions are resolved starting with the lowest
initiative roll to the highest.





The result is the Time Unit (TU) in which you start to act w/o penalties.
After the initital initiativ roll, simply add your WS each time you want to
make an attack and sum the numbers.





One TU is roughly equal to 1 second.






Next TU you can act w/o penalties = Current TU + WS




Initiativ Modifiers (Optional)


You can choose to act earlier with a penalty of -5 per TU to early,
or you can increase your chance of success by delaying up to 5 TUs and
gain a +2 bonus for each TU.






Max Bonus = +10







Action resolution

Once all actions have been declared, they are resolved using standard Skill
checks. The order of the resolution does not matter (Unless you use the optional
alternate inititiv mechanism) since all actions within a round are considered
to be simultaneous. Again, resolving the actions in a fixed order will speed up
the game and simplify combat.



While there are no strict limits to the actions that can be attempted during
combat, we will focus here on the actions that are directly related to the
resolution of combat.


Targeting

The determination of an attack outcome is achieved using the targeting
equation:




d10-d10* + SA [+ Sk mods] &gt;= d10-d10* [+ TD mods] + SD [+ Sk mods]




If the left hand side is greater than or equal to the right hand side, then 
the attacker scores a hit and should proceed to determine Damage.



While this expression may seem complex, it summarizes a very simple process:




Both the attacker and the defender roll d10-d10*, as in a Skill check.
The attacker adds his Attack Skill (SA) to his roll, while the defender adds his Defence Skill (SD) to his roll.
They also add any situation combat modifiers that the GM judge necessary to their respective rolls.
If the attacker's total is greater than or equal to the defender's total, then the attacker is successful in his attack and should now roll for Damage.




The targeting roll can be modified by situation combat modifiers. These
situation combat modifiers are chosen by the GM and are broken into two
categories:




Task Difficulty Modifiers (TD mods): modifiers that affect the difficulty of the combat Task.
Skill Modifiers (Sk mods): modifiers that affect the Skill of the combatants.



Task Difficulty Modifiers



ConditionModifier


Target Semi-prone-1
Target Prone-2
Target Partly Immobile-4
Target Immobile-8
Target Invisible+5 (Varies)
Target out of range+1 / 10% beyond weapon's range
Target Size(SR Attacker - SR Target)





Skill Modifiers



ConditionModifier


Semi-prone-1
Prone-2
Partly Immobile-4
Immobile-8
Poor Footing/Environment-1 to ... (Left to GM discretion)
On higher ground than opponent+1
Charging+2 Attack, -2 Defense
Set to receive a charge+2 Defense (assuming Attacker is charging)
Hasted+2
Slowed-2
Invisible+5 (Varies)
Feinting+5 (Optional)
Additional Action Attempted-5 per additional action
Injury-1/5 points or 
-1/([BOD + 10] / 2) (Optional but more realistic)
Fatigue-1/point (Optional)



The modifiers apply to both attack and defense skills, unless noted.
Modifiers that apply only to the attack skill are identified with
"+X Attack", while those applying only to defense are noted with "+X
Defense".




Optional:
For NPCs, the GM may replace the defender roll by a constant value of 0 to
accelerate combat resolution:






d10-d10* + SA [+ Sk mods] &gt;= 0 [+ TD mods] + SD [+ Sk mods]






This increases the effects of a difference between the Skill levels of the
attacker and defender, i.e. the opponent with the Skill will win more often
than when both opponents roll for defense.


   


Of course, the GM can decide that neither PCs, nor NPCs roll for defense.



Action Resolution

Game situation:
  (first round) Neila swings her war hammer at the nearest skeleton.
  -&gt; Bob rolls 3 and adds Neila's attack skill of 8 for a total of 11.
  -&gt; The game master rolls -2, adds the skeleton guardian defense skill of
     8 and a skill modifier of -2 due to the fact that the guardian is still 
     taking shape, for a total of 4.
  Neila hits the skeleton and sends crushed bones flying. In the meantime,
  Jalik wields his two swords.

  (sixth round) Neila is still engaged with two Guardians; she has suffered
  a few hits but has nearly destroyed the first while dodging the other.
  Jalik has also hit is Guardian a few times, while taking only two hits.
  Neila's attack:
  -&gt; Bob rolls 23 (!), adds Neila's attack skill of 8 and substracts 5
     because of the multiple actions (attacking and dodging) for a total
     of 26.
  -&gt; Game master rolls -7 (!) and adds the skeleton defense skill (8) for
     a total of 1.
  ===&gt; Neila scores another precise hit on the first skeleton.
  1st skeleton's attack:
  -&gt; Game master's roll: -9 + 8 = -1
  -&gt; Bob's roll: -2 + 14 - 5 = 7
  ===&gt; Neila blocks the skeleton attempts.
  2nd skeleton's attack:
  -&gt; Game master's roll: 3 + 8 = 11
  -&gt; Bob's roll: -1 + 13 (dodge skill) - 5 = 8
  ===&gt; The skeleton hits Neila.
  Jalik's attack:
  -&gt; Roger's roll: 6 + 11 = 17
  -&gt; Game master's roll: -1 + 8 = 7
  ===&gt; Jalik successfully stabs at the skeleton.
  3rd skeleton's attack:
  -&gt; Game master's roll: 7 + 8 = 11
  -&gt; Roger's roll: 7 + 8  = 11
  ===&gt; The skeleton hits Jalik.

Realistic Combat (Optional)


You can split up both your attack and defence into smaller portions of your
total Skill, but you must use at least 1 Skill point to do an action.





Keep in mind that your SA and SD is in fact only one Skill. The numbers may not
be equal due to Attak- and Defence Modifiers (AM/DM).





Thus, the amount of Skill you wish to use in an attack, a feint, a defence or
whatever is subtracted from both SA and SD.





As long as either your SA or SD is greater than 0 you may continue to do
actions. If your SA is reduced to 0 you may not attack anymore.
And if your SD is reduced to 0 you may not defend anymore.





The only situation where you may continue to defend even if your SD is 0, is
if your SA is greater than 0. Then you can use your remaining SA as SD.





Note: You can use SA as SD, but not the other way around.





When both your SA and SD is equal to 0, you must wait in WS TUs before you can
do actions again. Or, if you are using the Optional Combat Modifiers, act
later/earlier with coresponding modifiers.

  2 Shortswords   S/T   0/0      1

Neila and Jalik decides to do some combat practice.
They start out beyond each others reach. Both rolling for initiative (d3).
Neila rolls a 2 + 1 (WS) = 3.
Jalik rolls a 1 + 1 (WS) = 2. Jalik has initiativ.

(In situations like this, its not nesessary to roll for initiative unless both
insist on attacking first.)

He decides to wait, focus his attention and observe Neila.

[In game terms: +2 bonus/TU to whatever action he decides later on.]

Now Neila has decided to see if the saying "Attack is the best form of defence"
holds true. But she knows Jalik is a skilled fighter and will try to feint for
a opening in his defence.

[In game terms: 2 points of her skill will go into an initial feint, 4 points
will go into the actual attack. The remaning 2 will be held back in case of a
counter attack from Jalik.]

She takes a few quick steps forward toward Jaliks right, holding her shield
between herself and Jalik, seeing Jalik drawing his defence to her feint, she
takes one long fast step to the right and lashes out at his left flank.

[In game terms:
Neila feints attack: d10-d10* + 2 + 5 (feint bonus)
                         -10  + 2 + 5 = -3 (a terrible feint)

Neila attacks: d10-d10* + 4
                     3  + 4 = 7
]

Jalik, seeing Nelias obvious feint, decides to play along, feinting a defence
where Neila expectes him to. Jalik decides for himself that due to Nelias
terrible feint, she will focus her energy mainly on the following attack.
With his left hand sword he decides to focus most of his skill to parry her
attack, and then counter with his right hand sword to lash out at her shield
flank, aiming for her (hopefully) exposed left leg.

[In game terms: 2 points of his skill will go into playing along with the feint,
6 points will go to the left hand defence and the remaining 5 points (3 from
his attack skill + 2 bonus points) will go to his last right hand attack.

Jalik feints defence: d10-d10* + 2 + 5 (feint bonus)
                            4  + 2 + 5 = 11 (a good feint)

11 &gt; -3 (Neilas feint attack) -&gt; Jaliks feint succeeded.

Jaliks left hand parry: d10-d10* + 6
                              9  + 6 = 15

15 &gt; 7 (Neilas attack) Jalik successfully parries Neilas attack.]

Neila, realising her failure as Jalik easily parries her attack and counters,
can do nothing but use her remaining skill to defend herself as best she can.

[In game terms:
Jaliks right hand attack: d10-d10* + 5
                                5  + 5 = 10

10 &gt; 6 (Neilas shield bonus + remaining defence).

Jalik hits Neilas left flank. Roll damage.]

Because this is only a practice session, Jalik holds back his attack enough for
Neila to just get a tiny scratch. She staggers backward to a defencive positon,
preparing herself for a new clash of arms.

In this situation, I guess we can say that attack was NOT the best defence. :)

This entire combat scene lasted only a few seconds. Both Jalik and Neila must
now regain consentraton, focus and whatever before they can act without
penalties. This is determened by their weapons SPD. They must wait in Time Units
equal to their SPD. This means they must both wait 1 Time Unit. Then they start
all over again.





Called Shots

Targeting a specific body part is refered to as a Called Shot. While
targeting vital organs can increase the deadliness of an attack, those vital
organs are often small and thus more difficult to hit.



The table below gives Impact modifiers for some human body parts. These
modifiers are based on the probability of hitting a vital organ in the
targeted part. The effect of hitting non-vital organs is left to the game
master.





For example, a serious blow to the hand might cripple its victim in
addition of doing normal Impact.





Listing all such consequences is beyond the scope of these rules.


Impact Modifiers vs Body Parts



Impact ModifierBody Part


+10Head
+15Throat
+20Eye/Heart





When making a Called Shot, the targeting roll of the character is modified
by the Size Rating (SR) of the body part targeted. This SR can be determined
from the Size Rating table below. You can either estimate the average dimension
of the targeted part and look for a matching number in the size column, or just
scan the examples for a part of similar size.



Targeting equation for called shots:




d10-d10* + SA &gt;= TD - SR




Called Shots are generally applied to missile weapons. In melee combat
battling an opponent larger than you does not make him much easier to hit
since he also benefits from an extended reach.



Most values listed are for human body parts. You can convert to the species
being targeted very simply, by adding the Size Rating of the Species to the
Size Rating of the human body part.




Body Part SR = Human body part SR + Species SR



Body Part Size Rating

SR of human arm  = -4
SR of weejon arm = SR of human arm + SR of Weejon
                 = -4 + -3
                 = -7




What happens if a player targets an opponent's eye or another body part and
miss by one on his attack roll? Since we don't want to get into overly
complicated and cumbersome mechanics, we leave this to the interpretation of
the GM. It could either be treated as a complete miss, a hit to a nearby bone
that only does normal Impact or a full hit to the head.
Situational modifiers that may influence this decision include the movement
speed of the opponent, the fact that he may be wearing a helmet, etc.

Targeting with Missile Weapons

Missile Weapon Styles are handled as standard Skills, with a TD that is
mainly dependent on the distance between your character and its target. For
simplicity, the base TD does not depend on the weapon used and is given in the
following table:


Targeting with Missile Weapons



DistanceRangeBase TD


Near0 to 10 meters0
Moderate11 to 50 meters5
Far51 to 100 meters10
Extreme&gt; 100 meters15





The targeting equation is:




d10-d10* + Missile Weapon Skill &gt;= TD




Since all missile weapons are not equal in effectiveness, an effective range
is associated with each one. When the target is beyond a weapon's effective
range, additional penalties are applied to the task difficulty. The TD
increases by 1 for each 10% over the weapons effective range (round up).
As usual, the GM can either apply this rule as a strict rule, as a
simple guideline or even completely dismiss it. Sometimes, it is simpler to
just consider all situational modifiers and make a quick decision on the TD.



Missile weapons also have a maximum range beyond which they cannot send a
missile. This maximum range is normally listed in the weapons description.



Damage and called shots are handled in the same manner as for melee attacks.


Targeting

In the following examples, we use one weapon of each group: a dagger,
(effect. range: 15m; max. range: 40m), a short bow (effect. range: 90m; max.
range: 225m) and a heavy arbalest (effect. range: 60m, max range: 330m).

Situation 1: Target is 8 meters away.
  TD is 0 with all three weapons, since the target is near and within their 
  effective range.

Situation 2: Target is 20 meters away.
  TD is 9 with the dagger since the target is in medium range (TD 5) and is
  5 meters over the dagger's effective range. (20 - 15) / 1.5 ~= 3.3 = 4.
  TD is 5 with both the short bow and arbalest, since the target is within
  their effective range.

Situation 3: Target is 100 meters away.
  Such a dagger throw is "impossible" since the target is beyond the dagger's
  maximum range.
  TD is 11 with the short bow since the target is far (TD 10) and is
  10 meters over the bow's effective range. (100 - 90) / 9 ~= 1.1 = 2.
  TD is 17 with the heavy arbalest since the target is far (TD 10) and is
  40 meters over the bow's effective range. (100 - 60) / 6 ~= 6.7 = 7.

Situation 4: Target is 500 meters away.
  Don't even think about it...




Targeting TD Formula:




TD = (Range - Effective Range) / 10% of Effective Range





Optional:
In some situations, it makes sense to take into account the size of the
target. In these cases, the TD can be modified by substracting from it the
SR of the target.



Size Rating Adjustments


Hitting a giant (SR: 4) standing 20 meters away with with a short bow has a
TD of 1, while hitting a weejon (SR: -3) at the same distance has a TD of 8.






As a reference, humans have a SR = 0. The game master is free to apply this rule
whenever he wishes.






Size Rating Adjustement: Adjusted TD = Standard TD - SR





Damage and Injury

When a successful hit has been scored, Damage is computed by substracting
the defender's Resistance from the attacker's Impact.




Damage = Impact - Resistance




The attacker's Impact is the sum of his Strength and his weapon's Impact:




Impact = Weapon Impact + STR




The Resistance of the defender is the sum of his Natural Resistance and
his armor's Resistance:




Resistance = Natural Resistance + Armor Resistance




Armor Resistance is always a positive value that depends on the type of
armor being worn. Natural Resistance is a value representing the natural
body covering of a species (see the species description). Natural Resistance
can be negative. Because of this, Resistance can be negative as well.



If Damage is lower than 0, then it is considered to be 0. A Damage of 0 or
less is considered to be just a scratch. If Damage is greater than 0, then
it should be added to the Injury heap.




Injury = Injury + Damage



Impact and Injury

Game situation:
  (first round)
  To determine the Impact done by Neila's hit on the skeleton, Bob rolls
  11 on 2d6+4 (the war hammer Impact) and adds Neila's STR for a total of
  14. The GM substract the Natural Resistance (5) of the Guardian from
  Neila's Impact and adds 9 to the Guardian's Injury Heap (previously at 0).

  (sixth round) (Note that Damage calculations are normally done just
  after determining if an attack was successful. All Damage calculations
  are presented here in the same section for explanation purposes)
  -&gt; Neila hits the first skeleton for 11+3=14 points of Impact. This
     increases the skeleton's Injury by 9 to a total of 36.
  -&gt; The second skeleton hits Neila for 8+2=10 for a Damage of 4 after
     the attack has passed through the armor (Resistance=6). This
     brings her Injury heap to 26.
  -&gt; Jalik hits the third skeleton for 6 points of Impact. Only 1 point
     passes the skeleton's Natural Resistance, bringing its Injury
     Heap to 24.
  -&gt; The third skeleton does 13 points of Impact to Jalik. His armor only
     absorbs 3 points, adding 10 points of Damage to Injury, for a total
     of 18.



Bonus Impact (Optional)



Bonus Impact = [SA [+ SA mods] - (TD [+ TD mods] + SD [+ SD mods])] / 2
             = (Total SA - Total SD) / 2






This is the same formula used for standard targeting, only instead of just
comparing the sides we find how mush greater the left hand side is.
If the Bonus Impact is less than 0, the attack misses.





Note that for every 2 points of success above the TD, the Bonus Impact is
increased by 1.






Total Impact = Bonus Impact + Weapon Impact






Multiple Actions in Combat

The Multiple Actions mechanism is used frequently in combat. When a
character wants to defend against multiple opponents, he has to buy Multiple
Actions for a penalty of 5 on all his Skills. Each additional Combat Style
action gives both one attack and one defense.


Multiple Actions in Combat

If a character attacks and defends against two opponents, his two attacks and
two defenses are done with a -5 penalty. Similarly a character attacking one
opponent and dodging two others would have a -5 on his rolls in both his Combat
Style and Dodge Skill.




Actions that are not related to combat also impose a -5 penalty on all Skill
checks when they are performed while the character fights. If a character
wants to catch an object while fighting, he would face a -5 penalty on both
his catching roll and his attack and defense.



Note that the defense Skill of the character can never be lowered below 0 by
any penalty, since a defense of 0 is that of a moving target within range.
It is considered that your character cannot do worse if he tries to defend
than if he does not try to.




Survival checks

At the end of the combat round, after all actions have been resolved, every 
combatant that has been injured during the round (i.e. that has seen his 
Injury Heap increase) must make Unconciousness and Death checks.



An Unconsciousness check is made by rolling d10-d10* and adding 25 plus the
character's Willpower and Body. If the total is greater than or equal to
Injury, then the check is successful and the character stays conscious.




Unconsciousness: d10-d10* + 25 + BOD + WIL &gt;= Injury




It is not necessary to make an Unconsciousness check if 25 + Body + Wilpower is
over Injury by 10 points or more.



A Death check is similarly made by rolling d10-d10* and adding 40 and the
character's Body. If the total is greater than or equal to the Injury, then
the check is successful and the character stays alive.




Death: d10-d10* + 40 + BOD &gt;= Injury




It is not necessary to make a Death check if 40 + Bodyis greater than Injury
by 10 points or more.




Optional:
If the Graded Outcomes rules are used, a partial outcome indicates that the
character is not Unconscious but suffers from such pain that he is not able to
do anything beside moaning and screaming. He remains generally aware of what is
happening around him.



Survival Checks

Game situation:
  (first round) The Injury heap of the first Skeleton Guardian is now equal 
  to 9. Since this is much lower than 40 plus the Body of the skeleton,
  there is no need for a Death check (the skeleton does not check for
  Unconsciousness, see description).

  (sixth round)
  -&gt; Bob's roll for Neila: -3 + 25 + 2 (WIL) + 2 (BOD) = 26 (Injury)
     Neila remains conscious enough to continue the fight. 
  -&gt; Roger's roll for Jalik: -2 + 25 + 0 (WIL) + 1 (BOD) &gt; 18 (Injury)
     Jalik remains conscious.
  -&gt; GM's roll for the 1st skeleton:
     -6 + 40 + 0 (BOD) &lt; 36 (Injury)
     The skeleton crumbles into a heap of broken bones.
  -&gt; The Injury of the third skeleton (24) is much lower than his 
     BOD (0) + 40, so there is no need for a death check.




Unarmed Combat
Unarmed Attacks

There are five types of unarmed attacks. For game mechanics, they are
handled the same way as weapons are handled in armed combat styles.
They have an associated damage, reach, etc, just as weapons do.
An unarmed defender against a weapon gets no defence or a penalty, depending
on the fighting style being used.

Bashing attacks include body slams and tackles. IMPACT is 2d6-4.
A running start is required to do damage, so no IMPACT is done if you are
already at close range. (possible to force backwards even if starting at close
range)



Throws include leg sweeps and judo/wrestling throws. IMPACT is 2d6-6 and
is not modified by STR. Success leaves the defender prone.



Hold attacks include judo holds and wrestling pins.  
After a successful attack the defender must make a roll if he wants to
try to break the hold.  




d10-d10* + STR + skill &gt;= holder's STR + skill




The "skill" may be from any style which includes "hold" attacks.
If the hold is successful, the attacker may choose to inflict damage: 




IMPACT is 2d6-4 (+STR).




* Note about HANDS: There are holds and throws which require two hands,
and some which require no hands. The GM may judge if a maneuver is possible
or more difficult (skill penalty) in some situations, such as if the player has
his hands bound.



Unarmed Combat Styles

I would like to use a minimal list of unarmed combat styles, since it is
more in the spirit of the current weapon styles. A well rounded martial
artist using this list would learn Karate for the hand and foot maneuvers,
Close Weapons for the usual list of Chinese peasant weapons, Judo for
the throws, Staff, and One-Handed Weapon skills.

Movement and Distances in Combat
Combat Movement

While it may be possible for some characters to cover 60 meters in a standard
6 seconds round, this is not a typical character nor a character loaded with
equipment. Even if he was, he would be in no condition at the end of the round
to carry out other actions. Moreover this speed allows for only the gentlest
of turns; Combat movement involves turns and other actions.



The maximum speed that a character can move at in melee and still be able to
perform other actions without penalty is the base movement speed. A human
character might move up to 5 meters during a round and attack without penalty.



If a character wants to move faster than the Base movement speed in melee
combat, the GM can require him to make an Agility check against a TD
ranging from 0 to 5. A character can always move at the Base movement speed
without a check (as long as he is not crippled).



When moving in a combat situation, a character must increase his Fatigue Heap
at least every 5 rounds (30 seconds). He may have to increase his Fatigue more
often if he manages to move very fast (above the sprinting speed).



Fatigue in Combat

In combat, be it melee or missile combat, the Fatigue heap must be increased
every 5 rounds (30 seconds), no matter what actions are performed (fighting,
moving, dodging, tending a wounded comrade, ...). As usual, Fatigue is
increased by 1 plus the Encumbrance Penalty.



If a character does not perform any action (he just stands there), then his
Fatigue does not increase.


Battle






Magic

Introduction

Like every other aspect of DNet, the magic system is essentially made up
of skills and tasks which use those skills. In the specific case of the magic
system, the skills are those which give a character the capability to cast a
magical spell, and the tasks are: first, the use of source skills to access
the power for the spell, and second, the use of conductor skills to actually
cast the spell.


Fireball Spell

To cast the "Fireball" spell involves two tasks,
the first of which requires the application of the "Power of Energy" skill and
the second of which requires the application of the "Fire Focus" skill.




Magic often varies from gameworld to gameworld, but the mechanics of how magic
works are still the same. In here we will use examples of how magic works of
the type of magic found in Corellus. The guidelines presented for created
types of magic and spells are just that: guidelines.


Magic Skills

There are two categories of magic skills in the DNet system. These are
source skills and conductor skills. For a character to successfully cast a
spell, he or she must successfully use source skills to make magical power
available, and then conductor skills to use that power.


Skills For Fireball Spell

A magus' "Fireball" spell requires the caster to use
the "Elemental Power of Energy" source skill and then
the "Elemental Fire Focus" conductor skill.




Thus, the character must succeed on two task resolutions: the first to gather
the necessary magical energy (source), and the second to use the energy made
available (conductor).


Sources

Source skills represent the ability of the caster to draw upon a particular
source of supernatural energy and make that energy available for the casting
of a spell. Sources are much like outlets in the modern world. Outlets are
useless by themselves, but when their energy is used by an appliance,
technological wonders occur. So, too, are source skills useless by themselves,
but when their energy is used by a conductor skill, magic happens.



Whenever a caster wishes to cast a spell, he must make the energy for that
spell available by using one or more source skills. Making the energy
available is a simple matter of making a  task check using the source skill
required of the spell at the Source Task Difficulty (TD) of the spell.


Source Skill For Fireball Spell

The "Fireball" spell has a Source TD of 13 and to use that spell
the caster must first make the Source task check:

   d10-d10* + "Elemental Power of Energy" Skill &gt;= 13




If the task check fails, the caster is unable to gather the energy required
for the spell and the spell fizzles. If the composite task check succeeds,
the character has successfully gathered the energy, and may proceed to
harness that energy using the appropriate conductor skill.



Conductors

Where source skills represent an ability to draw upon a particular source of
supernatural energy, conductor skills represent an ability to use that energy
in a particular way. Where a source skill is an outlet in the modern world, a
conductor is an appliance. Without electricity, appliances are useless by
themselves, but when they are given energy to work with they can do amazing
things. So, too, are conductor skill useless without energy from a source
skill, but when they have that energy, magic happens.



We must also take the analogy one step further. Not all appliances can plug
into all outlets throughout the world; they must have compatible voltages and
have the same type of current. Conductors, too, can only be used with those
sources with which they are compatible. Energy from any other incompatible
source is useless to them. The sources with which a given conductor is
compatible are listed in the description for that skill.



Once a caster has gathered the energy from a source, he or she can utilize
that energy by using a conductor skill. Similar to using source skills,
harnessing and shaping energy using conductor skills is a simple matter of
making a task check using the conductor skill required of the spell at the
Conductor Task Difficulty (TD) of the spell.


Conductor Skill For Fireball Spell

The "Fireball" spell from above has a Conductor TD of 5 which uses the "Elemental Fire Focus" conductor.
Therefore, to finish casting this spell (once energy has been made available from the appropriate source),
the caster must make this task check:

     d10-d10* + "Elemental Fire Focus" Skill &gt;= 5




If the composite task check fails, the caster was unable to successfully
conduct the spell's energy and an unpredictable result may occur; the power
was not properly "focused." Once the conductor task check has succeeded, the
spell is cast.




Optionally, a failure of the source check can cause damage to the caster.

*All Sources have an UP of Impossible.


Celestial Power of Darkness

The Celestial Power of Darkness is one of the two Celestial Powers, those
source skills used by Celestial Magi. This particular source allows a
magus to call upon 'negative' magical energy to use with the Celestial
Foci, those conductor skills compatible with the Celestial Powers and used
by Celestial Magi. Darkness, when used with a Celestial Focus, destroys or
diminishes that which falls under the purview of that Focus. The Power of
Darkness is not an evil power, as many seem to believe, it is simply one
of the destructive powers of the universe.



Celestial Power of Daylight

The Celestial Power of Daylight is the 'positive' Celestial Power. It is
used to build up and enhance in ways depending upon which aspect of the
power the magus chooses to focus into form and reality.



Elemental Power of Energy

The Power of Energy plays the role for Elemental Magi that the Power of
Daylight plays for Celestial Magi. This power creates, enhances, and
builds up the elements.



Elemental Power of Entropy

The Power of Entropy is the opposite of the Power of Energy. Its role is
similar to that of the Power of Darkness of the Celestial Magi. It tears
down, destroys, and subdues the elements under its control. It is the
unrelenting force in the universe that will not rest until all is
destroyed. Again, this Power is not evil inherently, only when used for
evil deeds.



Kundalini

Kundalini is the raw energy which exists in the Astral Plane. The Psionic
draws upon Kundalini and uses it through different Chakras (the associated
conductors) to achieve different effects. The Psionic is more versatile
than the Magi, but less powerful at manipulating his reality. None surpass
the Psionic's mastery of the mind, however.



Spirit of spirit

The Spirit world is the domain of the Shamanic spell-caster. For each type
of Spirit the Shaman wishes to contact and commune with, the Shaman must
have a Source skill. After the Spirit has been contacted using this Source
skill, the Shaman must commune with the Spirit using the Communion
conductor skill to attempt to explain to the Spirit what is desired, and
to convince the Spirit to do as it is asked.



Doctrine of deity

The power of the gods is available to those who call themselves Priests.
Priests worship one (or, rarely, more) deity who answers his Priests'
prayers and requests in the form of Miracles (spells). In order to have
one's prayers heard by a deity, the Priest must have a skill in that
deity's Doctrine. This skill represents how well the Priest knows the
teachings and requirements of the deity necessary to get part of the
deity's attention. The higher the character's skill in Doctrine, the
greater portion of the deity's attention is gained. Once the Priest has
successfully contacted the deity with a Doctrine skill, he must pray the
the deity does as he wishes, the success of which is determined by the
Priest's Piety skill to that deity.

*All Conductors have an UP of Impossible.


Elemental Air Focus

The focus of air is the ethereal aspect of the elemental powers. It
controls winds and gravity. With the energy of air, a magus can fly above
his enemies, or blow thunderstorms over their heads. The entropy of air
can cause suffocation of his enemies, or bring things down to earth.



Elemental Earth Focus

The earth is the focus of physical power. This aspect of energy affects all
things with solid physical form. With this power the magus may raise up
great mountains, or bring them crashing down upon his foes. The earth
aspect of entropy allows the magus to destroy the physical. With it he can
disintegrate physical objects and beings, or create doorways where none
were before.



Elemental Fire Focus

Fire is the form of true power. Fire is heat, warmth, life, and energy. By
mastering the aspect of fire, a magus can hurl balls of flame towards his
enemies, or keep warm on a cold winters night. He can cause forest-fires
in the dead of winter, or light a dark passage. Using entropy, the magus
can hurl balls of ice, or stamp out natural or magical flames, or even put
out the fire within each person.



Elemental Water Focus

The water focus is the domain of the seas and the lakes. It has complete
control over liquids in all its forms. It can bring water into being for
the benefit of the magus, or drown the magus' enemies. It can also create
patches of ice, or slippery stones. The entropy aspect of this focus
destroys water, soaks it up. This aspect can turn an enemy into parched
dry bones instantly, or dry up a lake which happens to be in the way.



The 5th Elemental Focus

Powerful Elemental Magi have theorized the existence of a 5th Element of
unknown properties which could be used with the Energy or Entropy sources
of Elemental magic. Unfortunately, no one has yet discovered this elusive
Element, or determined its probable nature. Perhaps the sages of DnExotica
will, in time, solve this perplexing mystery :).




Current theories include the concept of an Element of Nothingness, or Void,
an Element of Pure Magic, an Element of Spirit, an Element of the Aether,
that which fills the Void, or a Quintessential Element. It is believed that
once the 5th Element is discovered, many of the mysteries of Elemental magic
will be solved.


Celestial Aurora Focus

The aurora, which appears in the northern night sky, is the most beautiful
and entrancing of all celestial elements. Through the study of this
wondrous effect, magi are able to draw upon and use its ability to charm
and entrance the observer. With this focus, the magus may charm an enemy
and calm his friends. With the darkness of the aurora, a magus may strike
fear into his enemy, remove charmed influences from his friends, and
prevent beguiling effects from manipulating himself or others.



Celestial Comet Focus

The comet is the messenger of the heavens. Continually moving at blinding
speeds throughout the night sky, it is the master of all movement. By
studying the properties of the comet, the magus is able to use its
movement for himself. With this focus he can instantly move anywhere in
the world, or, in combination with the focus of the firmament, he can even
move out of this world. The darkness of the comet prevents movement,
imprisoning and trapping enemies, and preventing others from coming near.



Celestial Firmament Focus

The light of the sky and the heavens above is the study of the firmament.
Those magi who strive to understand the magnitude of the firmament, are
able to transcend this reality and get a glimpse into other realities of
infinite varieties. Through this study, magi can commune with gods or
angels or demons. In combination with the field of comet, magi are even
able to walk the infinite planes of existence. Through the study of the
night sky, the darkness of the heavens, magi are able to block off the
conduits through which these inter-planar communion occur. With this
discipline, magi can return foreigners to their home realities, and
prevent their return, or stop the communication of other magi with
extra-planar beings.



Celestial Light Focus

Light is purity incarnate. This focus allows the magus to wield true power,
without manipulation. With it bolts of pure magical energy can spring
forth from the casters hand, or magical effects can be detected or
enhanced. The dark allows the magus to cancel the magic of others or
inhibit magic.



Celestial Moon Focus

The moon is the mistress of mysteries, the lady of the night. Under her
pale glow, reality takes on new dimension. By studying the moon, magi are
able to use her light to mask reality, to make what isn't really there
come to life. With this power, magi can weave strange and powerful
illusions of things which only exist by the light of the moon, though the
moon does not need to actually be shining for the magus to draw upon her
power. Those who study the dark side of the moon, on the other hand, can
see through all pretenses and appearances to the stark reality underneath,
though the vision is not always a pleasant one. Illusions have no affect
on those who wield the power of the dark side of the moon, and all that
was once hidden comes clear.



Celestial Stars Focus

The stars in their infinite formations hold the knowledge of all that was,
all that is, and all that will be. Through the study of starlight, the
magus can glean some small inkling into the vastness of the universe and
can divine what is and what will come. Through knowledge of the light of
the stars, all knowledge comes clear. However, by manipulating the dark
stars, magi are able to obscure the meaning the stars hold. They can
prevent less powerful magi from discerning particular knowledge, or even
misdirect such inquiries.



Celestial Sun Focus

The sun is the giver of life, the celestial orb that brings warmth and
health to all the realms. Therefore, the sun is the focus of life. The
celestial magus who masters the sun aspect of daylight masters life
itself. He is capable of healing, or even of bringing those which were
dead back to the realms of the living. However, the one who masters the
darkness aspect of the sun learn the true meaning of death, and with that
knowledge can bring death to others and undo the work of the sun.



Astral Chakra

This is the Chakra that allows the Psionic that in addition to the normal
capabilities of drawing power from the Astral Dimension, allows the
Psionic to also travel into this dimension and to summon creatures from
the Astral dimension.



Body Chakra

Man is not made of only a mind, but also a physical body. Through the use
of this Chakra, the Psionic can utilize the Astral energy to enhance his
physical attributes.



Dream Chakra

This powerful Chakra allows the Psionic to achieve superhuman feats, as he
accomplishes them not in this world, but the world of his dreams. Of
course, the unnaturally good is tempered with the unnaturally bad--most
Dream powers carry some penalty, as they are under control of the Psionic
subconscious, and not his conscious mind.



Emotion Chakra

This Chakra deals with the emotional, colorful side of the mind, whereas
Mind deals with the cold, logical side of the mind.



ESP Chakra

Clairvoyance, reading the future, picking up auras would be included in
this Chakra. It would also affect how much the psionic can perceive while
in the astral plane.



Mind Chakra

The Psionic's most powerful tool is his mind. Utilizing the Chakras of mind
allows the Psionic not only to delve deeper into his mind than he normally
would be capable of doing, but it also allows him to delve into the mind
of others when it is used in conjunction with other Chakras.



Reality Chakra

This Chakra is about imposing a Psionic's will over reality. Control over
Fire, Air, Water, and Earth would be included in this Chakra. A psionic
wouldn't be able to manipulate these elements as well as an elemental
magus. An example of this Chakra would be a fire-starter (pyrogenic).



Temporal Chakra

This Chakra would be allow the psionic to affect the flow of time and to
perceive in things in the future and/or past. Examples of this would be
(in conjunction with other Chakras) slowing down metabolism, fortune
telling, speeding healing, etc.



Piety to deity

The Piety skills represent how devout and reverent a character has learned
to act towards a particular deity. Because the nature of worship required
by separate deities is different, there is a unique Piety skill for each
deity. Pragmatically, the Piety skills are what keep Priests on the 'good'
sides of their deities. That is to say, the Piety skill helps to convince
the deity to act in the best interests of the Priest, after the Priest has
gotten part of the deity's attention, instead of, say, killing the priest. :)




Because the Priest must be able to gain a part of the deity's attention
before making his request, the Priest must first have at least 1 level of
training in the Doctrine skill of a deity before he may be trained in the
Piety skill of that deity.


Communion with Spirits

The Communion conductor is what allows those who weave Shamanic spells to
commune with the denizens of the Spirit world. It is this communion which
allows the caster to communicate to the Spirits his or her desires.
Without this, the Spirits would be powerless to help the caster. The skill
level a caster possesses in the Communion skill represents how capable the
caster is of communicating complex wishes to Spirits.




Before using the Communion skill, the caster must first contact the Spirit
with which he wishes to commune using the appropriate Spirit skill, and he
must, therefore, have some skill in a Spirit skill before gaining training
in the Communion skill.



Fatigue and Casting Time

Casting spells is neither instantaneous, nor easy. While some very simple
spells can be cast in one or two seconds and with little effort, most spells
take at least a full round to cast and leave the magic user fatigued.



When casting a spell, the magic user has to channel the magical energy,
which is a very demanding activity for the magus body. The fatigue created
by the spell is thus proportional to the amount of energy tapped, i.e. to
the Source Task Difficulty. The Fatigue heap of the magus is increased by
one plus one fifth of the Source TD, rounding up, after the spell has been
completed. If the spell fails, the magus suffers from only half the normal
Fatigue associated with the spell. This Fatigue affects all subsequent
actions, including other spells cast by the magus.



While tapping a Source of magical energy takes time, it is a fast process
which does not impact much on the casting time of the spell. Harnessing and
shaping that energy into a useful spells takes more time and the casting
time of a spell therefore depends on the Conductor TD. The casting time of a
spell is equal to 5 plus the Conductor TD in seconds. The spell goes off in
the round during which its casting ends.


Fatigue And Casting Time For Fireball Spell

The "Fireball" spell has a Conductor TD of 5 and thus takes 10
seconds to cast, going off in the round after the casting has begun. A spell
with a casting time of 18 seconds would go off in the third round of the
casting.




In the DNET system, each round lasts 6 seconds, so that there are 10
rounds per minute.




OPTIONAL:
If Fatigue is not used with the rest of the rules, the game master may wish to
simplify its application for the magi. One option is to increment Fatigue
normally when casting a spell, but not to apply it as a penalty to subsequent
actions. As a limiting factor to spell casting, the magi are only able to cast
spells for which their Source skill is greater than their Fatigue heap.



Alternate Fatigue


If a magician has a skill of 15 in the "Elemental Power of Energy",
he could only cast the Fireball spell has long as his Fatigue heap
remains below 15.




Magic Types Guidelines

Magic can come in many types and flavors. The GM will probably decide on the
types of magic depending on the type of world that is being played in. The
magic types in the standard world 'Corellus' provide good examples of how to
set up the types of magic.



The first thing that needs to be decided is what types of magical energy are
available for use. These are the sources that the players can use. Are there
any restrictions on these sources (e.g., priestly sources have the
restriction that the priest must be in good favor with that deity). Sources
have a base EP cost associated with them that reflects how hard it is to
draw on that source.



The next decision is, how can these sources be manipulated. These will be the
conductors. The conductors also usually have a base cost associated with them.
Other modifiers can be used from the table above.



The game master can also decide that each form of magic is associated with a
different vision of the world and that a single individual cannot embrace
more than one.


Magic Limitations

A magician specialized in the Elemental theory would not be able to perform
any Celestial spell, and might also have some difficulty with Psionics.




Once again, this kind of limitations are very world specific.



A template for magic types can be found in section 9.5.



Magic Spells

The casting of magic spells is the primary task to which source and conductor
skills are put. The variety in types of spells is as infinite as a player's
imagination. Spell effects may be small or large, blatant or subtle. Types of
spells range from powers of the mind to pyrotechnics of the skies. Yet even
with all of these differences, there are some basic rules and guidelines
governing the creation and use of spells in the DNet system.


Casting Spells

Casting a spell operates just like any other task in the DNet system with
two minor exceptions:





Successful spellcasting requires two consecutive, successful 
       task checks: the first to make the energy available to the caster,
       using source skill(s), and the second to harness that available energy
       using conductor skill(s). No conductor check is needed if the source
       check is failed





Secondly, spellcasting is much more tiring work than most activities. 
       To reflect this, the caster's fatigue heap is incremented by one plus 
       one fifth of the Source TD the spell the caster attempts to cast. If 
       the spell fails, the caster only suffers from half the normal Fatigue 
       increase.





Other differences may occur beyond those mentioned above, depending on the
spellcaster(s), the spell(s), and the skill(s) involved.




For example, some conductor skills require spells to be researched
or otherwise learned before they can be used.




In the standard rules, no spell requires any spell component, obvious
incantation or specific gesture. It is not meant that such requirement are
inappropriate, only that their application is left to the game master. Some
optional rules that integrate those elements may be included with the
standard rules in the future.



Spell Attributes

All spells have many of the same basic attributes. These attributes bear no
relation to a character's attributes, except in that they serve to define the
basic nature of the spell in the same way that character attributes serve to
define the basic nature of a character. The basic attributes and their values
are:


Source(s)

    Each spell must also define which source(s) of energy are used to draw the
    power required by the spell.



Source TD

    The total TD associated with gathering the energy from the source(s).



Conductor(s)

    Each spell must also define which conductor(s) must be used to harness the
    energy once it is gathered from the source(s).



Conductor TD

   The total TD associated with making use of the conductors.



Fatigue

    The Fatigue created by the spell.



Casting Time

    This value represents the amount of time it takes to successfully cast the
    spell. This value is the Conductor TD of the spell, in seconds.



Duration

    This value represents the length of time the spell lasts once it has been
    successfully cast.



Range

    This value represents the maximum distance, in meters, from the caster that
    the spell effect may be centered or initiated.



Volume of Effect

    This value represents the volume of space which is directly affected by the
    casting of this spell. (Note that secondary effects, like falling rocks,
    may extend beyond this range.)




Spell descriptions may augment or supersede this list of attributes.


Sample Spell

Fireball


Source: Elemental Power of Energy
Conductor: Elemental Fire Focus
Source TD: 13
Conductor TD: 5
Fatigue: 4
Casting time: 2 rounds (10 seconds)
Duration: 1 round
Range: 40 meters
Volume of Effect. A sphere with a radius of 5 meters

Allows the mage to create a ball of fire of 10m radius at up to 40m from the
caster. Any person within the ball must make an AGI roll against a TD of 5
to receive only half damage. The fire causes 2d6+1 of damage to anyone who
misses the resistance roll. The center of the fireball is located at most 1
meter from the area determined by the mage.





Making Spells

The procedure and rules used for making a new spell are entirely dependent
upon the types of conductor skills to be used by the Spell. Some conductors
require research and memorization, some require learning, others allow for
'on-the-fly' creation. Please see the conductor skill lists for specific
rules.



Standard spell creation rules have been designed for use with the magic
rules presented in this chapter. They  mainly consist in a set of standard
tables designed to calculate the Source and Conductor Task Difficulties. All
spells provided with the DNET system have been created using those tables
and all spells submitted will see their Source and Conductor TD evaluated
using them. You are free to ignore them completely if you find them too
cumbersome.



Tweaking Spells (VERY OPTIONAL)

Note: All the material presented in this section is optional.




The ability to tweak a spell allows a spellcaster to modify one or more of
the basic attributes of a spell, or (depending on the spell) some of the
specific effects of the spell.



Tweaking Spells


Putting more energy into a simple "Fireball" spell can increase
the damage it does, which is not a basic attribute.






For those spellcasters restricted to previously learned or researched spells,
the ability to tweak those spells they already know is a godsend. However, the
degree to which spells may be tweaked is limited, as are the ways in which they
may be tweaked.





When a caster tweaks a spell, he changes an aspect of the spell result by
changing either the Source TD, Conductor TD or both. Which aspects of a
spell may be tweaked, and to what degree at what cost, are generally
specific to the spell being cast. However, there are two general 'tweaks'
which should be available to almost all casters and for almost all spells:







The fatigue caused by a spell may be reduced by using more finesse.
       For every point by which the Source TD is decreased, the Conductor
       TD is increased by 2. Fatigue and casting time are adjusted to 
       reflect the changes.



  



The casting time of a spell may be reduced by using more brute force.
       For every point by which the Conductor TD is decreased, the Source 
       TD is increased by 2. Fatigue and casting time are adjusted to 
       reflect the changes.







Almost all other 'tweaks' change the Source or Conductor TD (and subsequently
both the casting time and the fatigue incurred) of the spell.
Examples of aspects of a spell which might be capable of being tweaked in
this way include:




Duration
Range
Volume of Effect
Damage




If the game master is very familiar with the magic system, he can guess the
variations in Source and Conductor TD on the fly when a mage attempts to
tweak a spell. Otherwise, it is suggested to use the spell creation tables
from the standard spell creation system.

The listed examples does not apply to every magical focus. See the description
of the foci to determen what each one can do.


Paradigms and Magic

Think of reality as a medium that has strong preferences for a specific
paradigm, in any given place. Different places (can) have different paradigms.
In any given place, then, there is one paradigm. That paradigm has a lot to do
with what the residents believe now (and/or have believed in the past).
It is important to understand, however, that while any paradigm is just a way
of doing reality, each paradigm is richly self-consistant, and that a local
area's paradigm changes much more slowly than the beliefs of any individual
resident. The momentary beliefs or confusions of residents is not the sum of
local reality.



Each paradigm is a system of explanations and methods for doing things.
Two systems are involved with every instance of magic.



1: The local static reality.



2: The magician's paradigm.



When you think about an act of magic, consider: did the two systems agree
(mostly) about the method/concept behind how the act was done?
The second thing to consider is, did anyone recognize that the two systems did
not agree (if they didn't)?



All the magic a magician does must have an explanation native to his own
paradigm. Magicans never do "raw magic," but they do know how to explain
everything they know how to do.



Next, it's important to understand that local realities are independant and
self-consistant.


Vulgar vs Nonvulgar

Something is nonvulgar when the method used to produce a reality-impacting
event is "believeable" by the standards of the local paradigm. Otherwise, it is
vulgar. Vulgarity does not hinge on what people in fact see. Vulgarity does not
hinge on any "trick" or bogus explanation for a magical effect, only on the
real explanations used by the local paradigm and the magician's paradigm.
People cannot sway the vulgarity of an isolated act of magic. They can either
witness it, or not. Vulgarity is solely an issue of whether the magician chooses
to use methods from within his paradigm that conform (adequately) to the local
paradigm, and is not an issue involving the perceptions of specific people.



Witnessed vs Not Witnessed

"Witnessed" happens only when people recognize that a specific event and method
violates the static reality. If they don't see it at all, it's "without
witnesses." If they believe in the way they think it was done, but that way is
not the way it was really done, it's "without witnesses."




How Paradigms Affect Spell Success

If the effect is nonvulgar: subtract 5 from TD.



If the effect is vulgar, but without witnesses: add 5 to TD.



If the effect is vulgar, and with witnesses: add 10 to TD.



The Laws of Magic

We are now ready to go into a description of the basic ways in which magical
phenomena seem to behave. The Laws of Magic are not legislative laws but,
like those of physics or of musical harmony, are practical observations that
have been accumulating over the course of thousands of years, with remarkable
similarity in almost every known human culture.

Those of you who prefer to remain skeptical as to the reality of psychic
phenomena and the systems of magic developed to control them will at least find
these Laws an interesting and detailed guide to what psychologists and
anthropologists so patronizingly refer to as "magical thinking."



Those of you who play magicians as characters will find these Laws a remarkably
concise guide to the ways in which most magicians, at least on this world,
believe magic to work. Most of the technical motivations of magic-using
characters, before, during and after using magic, will be based on these laws.



Along with each Law listed, I'll include key words to help in memorization.
These phrases are gross generalizations, but have the advantage of being brief
and easy to remember.



It's entirely possible that there are other Laws of Magic, however, I'm
currently unaware of any that are held to by most magicians on this planet.
Individual game designers and referees are free to invent new ones for their
game universes, but they will probably give the most accurate magic simulations
if they are congruent to these ones listed.


The Law of Knowledge

Essence: Understanding brings control; the more that is known about a subject,
the easier it is to exercise control over it.



Remarks: This Law is so fundamental that hardly any work on magic has ever
been published without mentioning it. The comments in Chivalry &amp; Sorcery
are quite appropriate here: "The Magick User might be compared to a combination
philosopher-sage-research scientist only those activities which directly aim at
increasing one's mastery of Magic itself can give the magician any experience
worthwhile to him." These comments are most accurate for intellectual magicians
of the theurgical sort but are more or less true of most other magic users as
well.



Keywords: Knowledge is power.


 
The Law of Self-Knowledge

Essence: The most important kind of magical knowledge is about oneself;
familiarity with one's own strengths and weaknesses is vital to success
as a magician.



Remarks: Most magicians quickly discover their own flairs and flaws. After all,
this is a large part of what Apprenticeship is all about. This is also why
"Evil Magicians" are comparatively rare in the real world (especially in the
"higher ranks") because a dedication to "Evil for Evil's sake" is almost always
due to a lack of introspection and self-awareness.



Keywords: Know thyself.



The Law of Cause &amp; Effect

Essence: If exactly the same actions are done under exactly the same conditions,
they will usually be associated with exactly the same "results";
similar strings of events produce similar outcomes.



Remarks: Magicians have at least as much belief in cause and effect as modern
physicists do, they just know that a good ritual, like a good poem or a good
bread recipe, isn't always absolutely predictable.



Keywords: Control every variable and you control every change, lotsa luck!



The Law of Synchronicity

Essence: Two or more events happening at the same time are likely to have
more associations in common than the merely temporal; very few events ever
really happen in isolation from nearby events.



Remarks: If you manage to pin a professional debunker against a wall (be
careful, they get nasty when cornered) you'll find that the word "coincidence"
is a scientistic term of exorcism, used to banish the demons of non-material,
and therefore unscientific, causality.



Keywords: Coincidence is seldom mere.



The Law of Association

Essence: If any two or more patterns have elements in common, the patterns
interact through those common elements, and control of one pattern facilitates
control over the other(s), depending (among other factors) upon the number,
type and duration of common elements involved.



Remarks: This is probably one of the most important of the magical Laws and
is directly connected to most of the others.



Keywords: Commonality controls.



The Law of Similarity

Essence: Effects are liable to have an outward physical or mental appearance
similar to their causes.



Remarks: Having an accurate image/sound/smell of an object or being facilitates
control over it or them.



Keywords: Look-alikes are alike.



The Law of Contagion

Essence: Objects or beings in physical or psychic contact with each other
continue to interact after separation.



Remarks: Everyone your character has ever touched has a psychic link with him,
though it is (probably) pretty weak unless the contact was intense and/or
repeated frequently. Naturally having a part of someone's body (nails, hair,
spit, blood, etc.) gives the best contagion link. Almost as good are objects of
clothing, handkerchiefs, bedsheets, etc., that have absorbed sweat or other
bodily fluids from the being your character wishes to magically influence.



Keywords: Magic is contagious.



The Law of Positive Attraction

Essence: Like attracts like; to create a particular reality you must put out
energy of a similar sort.



Remarks: This Law is often used in attraction spells, by saturating the aura
of the magician or client with symbols and energies similar to those wanted.
It's also commonly cited for moralistic purposes to discourage unwanted
magical behavior, on the grounds that behaving badly will attract evil or bad
luck. This Law may refer to morphic resonances; the tendency for energy shapes
to complete themselves, or perhaps wave entrainment, which is the ability of
particular vibrations to set up matching vibrations in nearby energy patterns.
If either of these phenomena happen with psychic energy fields, they could
easily cause the effects usually referred to by this Law.



Keywords: That which is sent, returns.



The Law of Negative Attraction

Essence: Like attracts unlike; energy and actions often attract their opposites.



Remarks: People say that like attracts like, but they also say that opposites
attract. This paradox can be reconciled by contemplating the classic yin-yang
symbol. The two halves of the yin-yang are opposite in color, but they are
identical in shape; thus opposite and similar on two different levels of
reality (or universes of discourse). Yet the two halves both attract and repel
each other in an eternal circular dance (see the Law of Polarity below).



Any phenomenon more complex than a bacteria can be viewed on several levels,
so you can usually find ways in which any two phenomena can be seen as either
opposite or similar, depending on which of these Laws of Attraction you are
interested in emphasizing.



The reason this hasn't been clear before is that Western Dualism usually picks
one aspect of existence that two phenomena have and insist that it is the only
important aspect as far as judging the phenomena to be similar or opposite.



Keywords: Opposites attract.



The Law of Names

Essence: Knowing the complete and true name of an object, being or process
gives one complete control over it.



Remarks: This works because a name is a definition (yes, even Harold, Marie,
Xunte, and Jasmine were at one time) as well as a contagion link. Perhaps more
importantly, it works because knowing the complete and true name of something
or someone means that you have achieved a complete understanding of its or his
nature. This is why, in most pre-industrial cultures, people are given secret
names as well as public names, and why the sharing of a secret name is such an
act of trust because the secret name is considered to be very close to, if not
identical with, the person's true name.



Keywords: What's in a name? Everything!



The Law of Words of Power

Essence: There exist certain words that are able to alter the internal and
external realities of those uttering them, and their power may rest in the very
sounds of the words as much as in their meanings.



Remarks: Many words are names and most have known definitions. Barbarous words
of power are (currently, if not originally) nonsense words that nonetheless can
release certain psychic phenomena and states. Very many magical tools require
words to be in-scribed upon them and/or to be said over them during their
creation.



Keywords: A word to the wise is sufficient.



The Law of Personification

Essence: Any phenomenon may be considered to be alive and to have a
personality, that is, to be an entity or being, and may be effectively dealt
with thusly.



Remarks: This Law is based on fundamental human thought processes and does
make doing magic, especially with abstract concepts, much easier. Most
magicians who do weather magic, for example, personify the winds and the
clouds, and thus find focusing their APK (atomic psychokinesis, psychokinesis
done upon the molecular, atomic or subatomic levels) upon the atmosphere much
easier.



Keywords: Anything can be a person.



The Law of Invocation

Essence: It is possible to establish internal communication with entities
from either inside or outside of oneself, said entities seeming to be inside of
oneself during the communication process.



Remarks: Either Invocation or Evocation can control the spirit communication
processes known as inspiration, conversation, channeling (mediumship), and
temporary possession.



Keywords: Beings within...



The Law of Evocation

Essence: It is possible to establish external communication with entities from
either inside or outside of oneself, said entities seeming to be outside of
oneself during the communication process.



Remarks: Evocation is the Law that controls most summonings.



Keywords: ... Beings without.



The Law of Identification

Essence: It is possible through maximum association between the elements of
oneself and those of another being to actually become that being to the point
of sharing its knowledge and weilding its power.



Remarks: This is the Law that controls most lengthy or permanent possession
phenomena.



Keywords: You can become another.



The Law of Infinite Data

Essence: The number of phenomena to be known is infinite; one will never run
out of things to learn.



Remarks: The best possible example of this is the Internet. You could spend
24 hours per day, seven days per week, and still never see 1% of the
information that's out there and most of human knowledge isn't on the Net yet
(as of 1998, anyway).



Keywords: There's always something new.



The Law of Finite Senses

Essence: Every sense mechanism of every entity is limited by both range and
type of data perceived.



Remarks: Many real phenomena exist which may be outside the sensory scanning
ability of any given entity.



Keywords: Nobody can see everything. Just because it's invisible doesn't mean
it's not there.



The Law of Personal Universes

Essence: Every sentient being lives in and quite possibly creates a unique
universe which can never be 100% identical to that lived in by another.



Remarks: So-called reality is in fact a matter of consensus opinions. There is
no single Reality that exists (whether people like it or not that odd idea is
popular due to monotheistic theologies and the Scientism they spawned) instead
there are multiple and frequently contradictory realities all existing
simultaneously. This Law may or may not be the same as the Law of Infinite
Universes.



Keywords: You live in your cosmos and I'll live in mine.



The Law of Infinite Universes

Essence: The total number of universes into which all possible combinations
of existing phenomena could be organized is infinite.



Remarks: Some people consider this Law to refer to the alternate probability
worlds of science fiction, however, it has a much wider application.



Keywords: All things are possible, though some are more probable than others.



The Law of Pragmatism

Essence: If a pattern of belief or behavior enables a being to survive and to
accomplish chosen goals, than that belief or behavior is "true" or "real" or
"sensible" on whatever levels of reality are involved.



Keywords: If it works, it's true.



The Law of true Falsehoods

Essence: It's possible for a concept or act to violate the truth patterns of a
given universe (including an individual's or group's part of a consensus
reality) and yet to still be "true", provided that it works in a specific
context.



Remarks: A data pattern may be true on one level of reality and false on
another, depending upon the circumstances involved.



For example, on the normal scholarly level of reality the Thunder Gods are
parts of the quaint mythologies of our ignorant ancestors and therefore false,
but on the level of reality involved in magical Rain-Making they are very real
indeed.



Keywords: If it's a paradox it's probably true.



The Law of Synthesis

Essence: The synthesis of two or more opposing patterns of data will produce a
new pattern that will be truer than either of the first ones were, that is, it
will be applicable to more realities (or levels of reality).



Remarks: This new pattern will not necessarily be a compromise but may be
something new.



Keywords: Synthesis reconciles.



The Law of Polarity

Essence: Any pattern of data can be split into (at least) two patterns with
opposing characteristics, and each will contain the essence of the other
within itself.



Remarks: Polarity should not be confused with dualism, a mistake that
Westerners have been making for four thousand years and which has quite
possibly led to more all-around misery than any other theological concept in
history. Dualism assumes that opposites are at war with one another; polarity
assumes that they embrace. The creators of D&amp;D did the game world a major
favor when they made neutrality a part of the political and moral alignments in
their game. The "Law vs. Chaos" and "Good vs. Evil" alignment systems so common
in fantasy games are dangerous oversimplifications but the addition of
neutrality and amorality (not to mention the new alignments that have been
invented by players and referees, such as hungry, weird, or whimsical) have
added far more creativity in character creation and play.



Keywords: Everything contains its opposite.



The Law of Dynamic Balance

Essence: To survive, let alone to become powerful, one must keep every aspect
of one's universe(s) in a state of dynamic balance with every other one;
extremism is dangerous on both the personal and the evolutionary levels of
reality.



Keywords: Dance to the music.



The Law of Perversity

Essence: Also known as Murphy's Law, Finagle's Law, etc.: if anything can go
wrong, it will - and in the most annoying manner possible.



Remarks: Magical associations sometimes operate in the reverse of what was
wanted; meaningful coincidences are just as likely to be unpleasant as they are
to be helpful (especially if a lot of emotion goes into the related situations).
Even if "nothing can possibly go wrong", some element of the universe may
change so that things will go wrong anyway.



This Law is probably based on the use of countermagic by one's own subconscious
mind, for whatever devious or even neurotic reasons it may have. My guess is
that it also ties in with the Anti-Psi talents. This Law explains why some
people's magic seems to work backwards. Emotionally healthy magicians have less
problems with this Law than unhealthy ones do, and once a magician has reached
the Master/Mistress rank his "klutz factor" tends to go down accordingly. The
klutz factor (or "fumble factor") is used by many referees to dampen down the
effectiveness of high-level magicians who are unbalancing their game universes,
but it has a basis in fact as well as in game playability.



Keywords: These can only be: If anything can go wrong, it will.



The Law of Unity

Essence: Every phenomenon in existence is linked directly or indirectly to
every other one, past, present or future; perceived separations between
phenomena are based on incomplete sensing and/or thinking.



Keywords: All is One.



Additional Notes on the Laws

Several of these laws are obviously a part of the metaphysical background of
magic rather than part of its day-to-day techniques. Some, such as Invocation
and Evocation, or Infinite Universes and Personal Universes, may actually be
the same principles seen from different viewpoints. A few of the Laws usually
seem to be subsets or intersections of other laws, as the chart clearly shows.


Similarity, Contagion &amp; The Golden Bough

The best known of the laws in Western literature are Similarity and Contagion,
both of which are subsets of Association, and both of which are famous thanks
to the writings of Sir James Frazer, especially the multi-volume Golden Bough.
The one-volume edition, edited by T. Gaster and published under the name The
New Golden Bough, is well worth reading if you haven't the steam to go through
all 10,000+ pages of the original but you'll miss a lot of good stuff.
Many fictional and nonfictional works in occultism, fantasy and science fiction
(not to mention anthropology) published since Frazer's time blithely assume
that these two are the only laws involved in magic despite the fact that ample
evidence for the other laws is often present within these works themselves.
Apparently, few scholars care to credit "ignorant savages" and "primitive
ancestors" with being able to organize their observations into coherent systems
of thought, let alone into complex philosophies.



It should be remembered that similarities do not have to be visual ones, in
order to use the Law of Similarity. Sounds, smells, textures, tastes, etc. can
certainly be used, as well as abstract similarities that exist only in the mind
of the magician. As for Contagion, the phenomena involved do seem to have
falling-off patterns, or "half-lives". The longer it has been since the contact
was last made or used, the weaker the contagion link will be. But these sorts
of half-lives, represent far too delicate of a variable to worry about in game
magic, unless an individual referee may care to wing it on such judgements.



These Laws combine frequently. Blood from an aardvark can always be used to
control more aardvarks than the original donor, because aardvark blood will
always be very similar to aardvark blood. Control spells will work best on the
original source of the contagion sample (and parts of the body are usually the
best samples) but a body sample can always be used to boost the efficiency of a
spell done on any entity with a similar body (and this body does not always
have to be organic - a magician having problems with technological devices
might choose to carry transistors or wiring samples around).



Invocations &amp; Evocations

The Law of Invocation is the main law used by Shamans and other Mediums because
it deals with various types of possessions. The Law of Evocation, however, is
used by Goetic Magicians and Necromancers to summon various spirits, human or
nonhuman, many of which may be parts of the subconscious or superconscious
minds of the magicians themselves. However, the various spells used in
roleplaying games for Summoning Monsters have nothing to do with evoking them.
These spells actually seem to be methods for seeking out (via Telepathy or the
Clair-Senses) the nearest "monster" of the sort desired and of either helping
or forcing them to Teleport to the summoner.



Universe Hopping

The Law of Infinite Universes could be used by magicians attempting to send an
object or being (including themselves) to another universe, or to retrieve
something or someone from another universe, as in various gateway spells.
While it is not mentioned by name, this law is actually the one used by the
protagonists to universe-hop in the (In-)Complete Enchanter series by Pratt
&amp; de Camp (who may have been the first folks to suggest using symbolic
logic equations to describe the Laws of Magic).



Tactical Polarity

The Law of Polarity can be used for tactical purposes in magical combat, since
every target is going to have a "weak spot" of some opposite characteristic
hidden deep within. Even the most stalwartly Good magician is going to have a
spot of Evil somewhere inside, though the higher his rank and the better his
emotional health, the weaker that spot will be (not only will it be harder to
get to, but it will be less useful to exploit).



The problem in most cases is to figure out just what constitutes the opposite
of a complex object or being. A Northern Fire Giant would have spots of
Southernliness, cold and dwarvishness inside his physical and psychic
structure, but only the cold spot would make a good flaw to concentrate upon in
most cases unless you could amplify his Southernliness to make him more
hospitable!



Perversity &amp; Wishing

The Law of Perversity can provide a number of amusing and infuriating incidents
in both real and game magic. In the occult community, one of the most popular
sayings around the world is "Always be careful what you ask for, you may get
it!" This leads into the subject of backfiring wishes, but wishes themselves
are such an irrational and absurd gimmick to throw into game magic systems that
it isn't even worth discussing them. They seem to be used mostly as a way to
cheat Fate and thus the game. The only magical excuse, explanation or plausible
reason for postulating the reality of the wishing phenomena is to assume that
there exist gigantically powerful mega-gods (probably of the Whimsical
alignment) who are contacted through the wishing devices and who delight in
performing full-scale miracles for (or to) stupid mortals. For those who insist
on wishing their characters out of every mess their bad play has caused, I have
only an old occult blessing: May your every wish come true.



Combining Laws

As a matter of practical use, the Laws are seldom if ever applied in isolation.
Usually two or more are combined.



For example: a party of travelers is going through the wilderness when they
come upon a hostile dragon. Their only mage, Belinda the Befuddled, decides to
try a Command Dragon Spell, so she reaches into her pouch and pulls out a wand
made of dragon bone (Similarity) which is carved with the likeness of a dragon
(Similarity) and with several runes (Words of Power). One end is capped with a
dragon scale (Contagion, since she found it in the woods the previous night and
it actually belongs to the dragon in question, but it also works as Similarity)
and the other end is tipped with a crystal carved into the likeness of a dog's
paw (Similarity, to the deity about to be invoked). Calling upon the divine
name of Mighty Manfred the Dragon Slayer (Names, Invocation) the magician pulls
in extra mana from her deity, which she then sends forth with several Words of
Power in Auld Wurmish (a dragon language, and therefore more Similarity),
Mesmerically sending her commands to the dragon. Snarfblatt the Mighty promptly
forgets about his intention to eat the travelers and instead flies away to look
elsewhere for lunch. With great dignity, Belinda faints from relief.





How the Laws Affect Spell Success

There should be a way to add to a character's chances of success, when the
magician uses one or more of the Laws of Magic in the spell design. One way of
doing this is shown in the table below, in which particular uses of laws add
Possibility Increments (PIs) to any spell's Possibility of Spell Success (PoSS).




Using that system, Belinda the Befuddled got quite a bit of improvement
in her chances for success, with credit for using Similarity five times, Words
twice, and Contagion, Invocation &amp; Names once each. Even though she's only
using a single Psi Talent (Mesmerism) and probably couldn't have done it
without help from Mighty Manfred, still her multiple use of the Laws could
easily boost her success possibilities to her Magical Luck Limit for her rank.



Effects of the Laws of Magic on Possibilities of Spell Success

1: For every usage of a Law of Magic (except those listed below) in the casting
of a spell, add 1 to the PoSS. If the same Law is used more than once, add the
appropriate bonus for each usage.



2: For every usage of the Law of Similarity: add 1-4, depending upon the
degree of similarity involved.




Attempting to cast a spell on a gnome. Having a crude drawing of a dwarf
(another type of small humanoid) is barely worth 1. Having a coffeetable Book
of Gnomes is worth 2. Having a realistic painting of the gnome in question is
worth 3. If photographs are possible in the game universe involved, one might
push the bonus up to 4 for having a photo of the gnome.




3: For every usage of the Law of Contagion: add 1-5, depending upon the degree
of contagion involved.




Attempting to heal a damaged comrade from a distance. Having shaken hands with
her several times is barely worth 1. Having an item of her clothing or weapons
is worth 2. Having a lock of her hair is worth 3. Having kissed her a lot
recently, or having had more intense contact, may well be worth 4-5
depending on just how friendly you got! Being able to touch the target of a
spell during the casting period will usually add 2.




4: For every usage of the Law of Names: add 1 for using the target's "public
name", add 2 for using the target's "childhood name" or adult "pet name", add
3 for using the target's "secret name", and add 6 for using the target's
"true name". Target beings will usually know their own names in the first three
categories, but only a supernatural entity is liable to know their own or
someone else's "true name".



Note: An Invocation or Evocation bonus cancels out any connected Names bonus.



5: For every usage of the Law of Invocation or the Law of Evocation: add 1-4,
depending on one's own Piety; 1 for low Piety, 2 for average Piety, 3 for
high Piety, 4 for highest Piety. Some referees may prefer to use the
character's "State of Grace" for this.



6: For every usage of the Law of Perversity: add 3 if and only if Negapsi is
one of one's Gifts. Otherwise, subtract 3 or "crock" the results of the
spell. If the referee or the player determines that a given magician is
suffering a "streak of bad luck", expect the Law of Perversity (at referee's
option) to start making things even worse.




Parapsychology, the Apologetic Science

The people who have studied psi phenomena and powers quickly
divided everything into two categories: Extrasensory Perception
and Paraphysics (thats "mind over matter"). I have added a third
category: Hypercognition ("super fast thinking"), plus a new area
called Anti-Psi for the barbarians.


Extrasensory Perception

      Extrasensory Perception is the reception of data without using
      the normal sense channels.


Telepathy

        Telepathy: the direct communication of data between minds. The
        data may be pictures, ideas, sensations, or emotions. The
        simpler the message, the more likely it is to get through and
        the greater distance it will go. As a rule, emotions and
        associations travel best. Derived from Greek "far-sensing."



General Extrasensory Perception

        GESP: together, the clair-senses are called GESP, or General
        ExtraSensory Perceptions.


Clairvoyance

        Clairvoyance: the reception of data which seems visual without
        the medium of another mind. A common type of clairvoyance is
        when you seem to see an image of a person or thing in your
        room. Often this image is connected with sudden death. This is
        called a "veridical hallucination" by some. Derived from the
        French "clear-seeing."



Clairaudience

        Clairaudience: is data input as normal sound even though the
        actual hearing of sound is impossible. Most spontaneous
        clairaudience takes the form of hearing "voices" or "sounds"
        connected with recent death or tragedy. Also derived from the
        French "clear-hearing."



Clairgustance

        Clairgustance: as above but using the sense of taste.



Clairolfaction

        Clairolfaction: as above but using the sense of smell.



Clairtangency

        Clairtangency: as above but using the sense or touch.



Clairempathy

        Clairempathy: most people say that a place or object has good
        or bad "vibrations" and leave it at that. A haunted house, for
        example, usually has some pretty heavy "vibes." When
        clairempathy is limited to objects, it is often called
        "psychometry," a term we will not use.




The Total Empath

        The Total Empath: is someone is simply absorbs the local
        "atmosphere" wherever he may be. Sometimes called "sensitives"
        these people are as a rule totally defenseless against psychic
        attack or even undirected strong emotion in their vicinity.
        They tend to die young, from emotional exhaustion, or wind up
        in mental institutions.



Psychic Vampires

        Psychic Vampires: Some empaths can control this absorption and
        literally drain others of their psychic energy. Sometimes
        known when habitually irresponsible as "psychic vampires".
        These people are on the border of Extrasensory Perception and
        Anti-Psi.



Astral &amp; Mental Projection

        Astral &amp; Mental Projection: these are defined as being GESP
        combined with concepts of "travelling" either through normal
        space or through various "astral planes." The difference
        between the types of projection is that in astral projecting
        you hallucinate the image of a slightly translucent body,
        called the "astral body", which rises from your physical body
        and carries your center of consciousness with it. In those
        rare instances when the agent has a maimed or crippled body,
        his astral body is usually perfect and unblemished. The famous
        "silver cord" that shows up often, but not always, in astral
        projection is basically an umbilical one connecting the navel
        of the astral body to the navel of the physical one. This cord
        can grow to be almost infinite length. Some experienced agents
        talk about looping the cord around trees or telephone poles to
        anchor themselves. Should your silver cord be cut, many claim,
        you would surely perish. Mental projection is said to be
        easier than astral projection and the reason is, I think, that
        agent actually generates his astral body and silver cord to
        comfort him in his fear that he might be seperated permanently
        from his physical body. As for the argument that astral bodies
        have been photographed, I suggest that that strong-willed
        person is using some Paraphysic talent to further enhance his
        astral body.



        Though many occultists today consider "astral planes" to be
        simply various parts of the mind, to the agent these planes
        are completely real and solid to his astral body. If an agent
        were to meet another agent upon these planes, both are capable
        of damaging eachother's astral body, damage which is firmly
        believed to be reflected on the physical body.



        Most personifications which the agent meets during astral
        projection are patterns within his own metapattern, and we all
        have some pretty nasty demons locked up in our subconscious.
        An agent who meets another actual agent in the astral plane is
        probably using the astral planes as an input device for
        telepathy.



Animal Psi

        Animal Psi: involves many different phenomena of unusual
        nature either occuring between humans and animals or between
        animals and animals or animals alone. Some of these are
        familiar to all of us; the dog or cat that travels thousands
        of miles to find his home after being lost; the dog who howls
        at his master's death, and so forth. Some laboratory
        experiments have been done which demonstrate the occasional
        use of telepathy between humans and animals.



Plant Psi

        Plant Psi: got its greatest publicity when a researcher
        decided to hook an EEG machine to some plants and record their
        reactions when he injured tissue by slicing or burning. He
        found that he didn't have to actually touch the plants to
        cause a reaction, the mere though ot hurting the plant caused
        the needle to swing wildly.




Paraphysics

      Paraphysics are types of psi involving apparently mental control
      over matter.


Pyschokinesis

        Pyschokinesis: the psi talent having the most laboratory
        evidence accumulated in its favor, it seems to have been shown
        that people can move matter and control what should be the
        random movement of small objects such as dice. When an object
        or person floats across the room, this form of PK is called
        levitation. This has some connection with the traditional
        skills of Eastern adepts in making objects heavier or lighter,
        something we would call Mass Control.



Teleportation &amp; Apportation

        Teleportation &amp; Apportation: are the instant moving of people
        and things (respectively) from one point to another without
        going throught space as we know it. Teleportation has been
        done only in fiction, myth, and scripture, though sufficient
        enough to raise suspicion. Apportation has been done in the
        laboratory. Living creatures which were apported always died.



Atomic PK

        Atomic PK: the use of PK upon matter at molecular, atomic, and
        subatomic levels. As we shall see, the smaller the object, the
        easier it is use PK on it. Thus there is no reason not to
        extend PK on down to these levels. Some types of APK are:


Transmutation

          Transmutation: the alteration of the basic structure of
          matter by rearranging electrons, protons, nuetrons, and so
          on. Changing water to wine or lead to gold would be
          transmutation instead of "miracle" or "alchemy."



Psychopyresis

          Psychopyresis: the igniting and control of fires, done by
          speeding up atoms with APK.



Psycholuminescence

          Psycholuminescence: the control of photons and thus of
          light. This could account for halos, auras, mysterious
          lights, and a host of similar phenomena. From occult
          literature, it would seem that Psycholuminescence is the
          easiest form of APK to do. This probably has something to do
          with the fact that the photon is one of the smallest known
          subatomic particles.



Weather Control

          Weather Control: the moving of large amounts of air
          molecules and maybe water molecules, around. Much easier to
          do where the weather is less stable.




Cellular PK

        Cellular PK: the use of PK on living cells. People can be
        killed by curses without knowing that they have been cursed.
        People have been cured of genuine physical diseases at places
        like Fatima and Lourdes, as well as by local witch doctors.
        Hypnosis has been used to speed up the rate of cell regrowth
        in damaged tissue, healing burned skin, for example, in two or
        three days; without leaving scars. Spontaneous cures in cancer
        are almost always associated with a change in attitude on the
        part of the patient, who simply refuses to die. There is a
        phenomena I call CPK Assimilation in which the healer exhibits
        the the same symptoms as the patient for a short time, after
        which the disease vanishes from healer and patient alike. The
        Pomo Shamaness Essie Parrish contracted arthritis and diabetes
        this way.



Recurrent Spontaneous PK

        Recurrent Spontaneous PK: the cause of what are normally
        called "poltergeists" or "noisy ghosts." Almost all RSPK
        activity involves the movement of objects through space; the
        rest are matters of RS-APK where objects explode or implode.
        The move- ment of objects during RSPK form a "Vortex Field,"
        known in mathematics as the "Exponential Decay Function,"
        which is a formula for describing the conversion of energy
        from one form to another. In this case, it seems, the Vortex
        Field describes the conversion of Psychic energy to Kinetic
        energy.




Hypercognition

      Hypercognition: superfast reasoning, often using data received
      via ESP, usually at the subconscious or unconscious level,
      resulting in an accurate statement and presented to the
      conscious mind as "flash" of "inspiration" or as a "hunch." If
      you do this and arrive at a statement about the future, it is
      called Precognition, about the past and it is called
      Retrocognition.



Anti-Psi

      Anti-Psi: this is the realm of those talents that frustrate,
      avoid, destroy, or generally mess up regular psi talents.


Catapsi

        Catapsi: the generation of "static" that cancels out psi
        powers within its range. It seems that the rabidly
        skeptical person is usually pretty good at generated
        prodigout amounts of Catapsi. Catapsi is the psychic
        equivalent of "white noise," energy being broadcast in
        random patterns, blocking coherent ones.



Splodging

        Splodging: a widespread general broadcasting of emotion so
        strong that is drowns out all other competing psi, and so
        strong that it even normally untalented people can pick it
        up. It usually occurs in anxiety states, and the Splodger
        is rarely aware of the fact that he is doing it. It has
        been called the equivalent of the "Psychic Yell" and often
        makes its recipient quite uncomfortable.



Apopsi

        Apopsi: this is the talent for being completely immune to
        any psi activity directed toward one. These people are the
        exact opposites of The Total Empath. Just as the Catapsi-er
        tends to have a hostile personality, the Apopsi-er tends to
        have a very withdrawn, unemotional nature.



Negapsi

        Negapsi: the "reversal" of any psi activity in the vicinity.
        If you are blessing a Negapsi-er it turns to a curse, and a
        curse to a blessing. If he tried to do Precognition it turns
        out to be Retrocognition. If he tries to score high on an
        ESP test, he score BELOW average.



Reddopsi

        Reddopsi: this is the ability to instantly return any psi
        aimed at you back to the point of its origin. If someone
        tries to curse a Reddopsi-er the curse will simply be sent
        right back to the curser, often without the Reddopsi-er
        consciously realizing it.

Using experience dice

Once the experience dice have been awarded by the Game Master, the player
has three options:




He can roll the dice and get a number of experience points equal to their total.



He can play safe and get a number of experience points equal to 4 times the
number of experience dice (1 dice = 4 EP).



He can divide his experience dice between the two options above,
choosing to roll some of them and to cash in the remaining ones.
The player must decide how many dice will be rolled before he starts rolling.




Of course, the Game Master may rule that some options are not available if he
feels that they are detrimental to the game.


Using Experience Dice

Say a player is awarded 10 experience dice. The player could:

1) Roll all 10 dice, which would generate from 10 to 60 points,
   with an average of 35.
2) Exchange the 10 dice for 40 experience points.
3) Roll 3 dice and cash in the remaining 7, which would generate
   between 31 and 46, with an average of 38.5.



Experience Dice During Play (Optional)


During a game session, if a character has some experience dice saved up,
he may use them for purposes other than skill advancement.





In this case, Experience Dice can be used for:




Improving a Task Resolution (d10-d10*) roll
Increasing an Impact roll




To avoid a penalty, a player must declare the use of experience dice BEFORE he
makes his roll. He should tell the GM that he wishes to modify his pending dice
roll with some experience dice. After the GM has been told how many experience
dice are going to be used in this way, the player rolls the total of the
original dice plus how ever many experience dice he told the GM he was going to
use.





If a player wishes to modify a die roll AFTER he has rolled the dice, he
must do so at a penalty of three times the cost; therefore, the player pays
three experience dice for each die added to the roll.





Affliction

Affliction is the general term given to any condition which will affect a
character adversly, such as poison and disease. The mechanics for determining
the results of disease or poisoning are the same.


Mechanics

All poisons and diseases have a Virulence rating. In basic terms, the
virulence is a measure of the strength of the poison or disease; the
difficulty a person has in overcoming it's effects.



There are two stages of affliction: Partial Effects and Full Effects. The
effect on a creature will vary from affliction to affliction. Some example
afflictions will be given below.



A character will suffer partial effects from the affliction if they fail to
make their Afflicted roll, and likewise, they will suffer the full
effects if they fail to make their Resistance roll, as given below:




Afflicted: d10-d10* + BOD + WIL &gt;= Virulence





Resistance: d10-d10* + BOD + FIT + 5 &gt;= Virulence




Each affliction will also be given an Onset Time. It is after the Onset Time
has passed that a character is allowed to make their Afflicted roll.



Should a character succeed in making their Afflicted roll, they will suffer no
adverse effects from the affliction. Should the Afflicted roll be failed, and
after the Onset Time has passed again, the character is allowed to make their
Resistance roll. If the character makes their Resistance roll, the affliction
will proceed no further and the character will recover in (Virulence - WIL - FIT) days.



If the Resistance roll is failed, the character will suffer, in addition to
the partial effects, the full effects of the affliction, and, if they survive,
will recover in (Virulence - FIT) days.



Dosage

Doseage for all afflictions is given as LD50 Doseage.
The LD50 doseage is defined as the dosage that will cause death in 50% of the
creatures exposed to that doseage.
The LD50 doseage is given or must be determined for each poison or disease.



For the administration of either larger or smaller doseages, the following
table is used to determine Virulence:


Virulence



DoseTDDescription


.12510
.2515
.520(Half the LD50 Dose)
1.025(LD50 dose)
2.030(Double the LD50 Dose)
4.035
8.040





For each doubling in administered dose, +5 is added to the TD. GM's should
note that, for poisons, an increased doseage administered will increase the
chance of the poison being detected.



Virulence Formula:

Virulence TD = 25 + 5 * log(Multiple) / log(2)




Multiple Formula:

Multiple (= Dose / LD50) = 2^((TD-25) / 5)




All LD50 doseages are given assuming roughly human body size and weight.

Guide to Species Creation

You need to follow these steps to create a species:


Deciding the general idea of the species

Height, weight and lifespan
Adjusting Talents
Base Speed
Natural Resistance
Innate ISB, Gifts and Foibles
Calculating EP cost
Cultures
IMPACT done by a species weapons



Deciding the general idea of the species

If you decide to create a new species then you normally have an idea of how
the species will look like and what are its special characteristics (i.e.
attributes, abilities, ...). If not, try to visualize a general picture of the
species and which role it will play in your world.



Can a PC be from this species?

If you want to create a new race for players then you need to calculate the EP
cost.This is the number of points that must be spent to choose this species as
a player character's race. Even if you create only a new monster then it will
be a good way to measure the strength of the species. Everything that gives
the new species some sort of power will raise the EP cost. And everything
disadvantageous to it will lower it. Balanced advantages and disadvantages
will keep the cost near 0.



Height, weight and lifespan

You then have to define the average



height in m,
weight in kg and
lifespan in years.



According to this you can also see which Size Rating the species has. This is
an additional value that will be used in combat. Humans have a size rating of
0.


Size Rating

You can determine the Size Rating (SR) of your species from the Strength and
Size Rating Table given below. Find the average height of your species in
the Humanoid Height column and note the corresponding SR. Note that this SR
is valid if your species has the same proportions as a human, i.e. if it has
the same ratio as a human between height and width. If the species is larger
for its height than a human, raise its SR value appropriately. If it is
slimmer, lower its SR.



The following table can be used to determine a number of factors relating
to a creatures size and strength.

Adjusting Talents

The steps above will tell you in which way you may change the Talents of the
species. The average attributes of a human are all 0 and ranges normally from
-5 to +5. When you adjust a Talent, you decide how much it will differ from
the human standard. You do this by adding or subtracting a specific value.


Adjusting Talents

The new species is taller and lighter than a human but more flexible
and agile. This could mean:
Talents modifiers: AGI +1, FIT -1, STR -1

The resulting EP cost would be -20. This could offset the cost of another
advantage.




The Talents are:
Physical Talents



AGIAgilityBody control; balance; rythm; flexibility
BODBodyResistance to injury; proportional to size
DEXManual DexterityHand-eye coordination; fine motricity of the arms and hands; sensivity to touch
FITFitnessBodily health; resistance to hardship, injury or disease
STRStrengthRating of Physical power for short and prolonged use





Mental Talents



AURAuraNon-tangible complement to beauty; charisma
INTIntelligenceMemory; analytical and reasoning ability; speed of thought
PERPerceptionIncludes alertness and observational acuity
PSYPsycheCreativity, Intuition, affinity to the natural and supernatural
WILWillpowerSelf discipline and mental fortitude (i.e. mental fitness)



For a detailed description of the attributes please refer to the character
creation guide in the rules.


Body Talent

A good way to estimate the average BODY Talent of your new species is to set
it in proportion with its size relatively to humans. The average human BODY
is equal to 0 and the average human size is 1.8 meters. The species average
BODY can be calculated from:




Humanoid species Weight = Species Height^2 * 25





Humanoid species BODY = SQRT(Species Weight) * 5/1.8 - 25




However, if a species is more bulky than humans for its height, then its
BODY should be set higher than what the formula suggests. In the same
manner, a very slim species should have a lower BODY value than that
calculated.



Strength Talent

In order to determine how strong a species is on average, you can use the
table in the Size Rating section. The Strength factor column indicates how
strong the species is relatively to humans, while the LIFT column indicates
the maximum mass that an average member of the species can lift overhead
most of the time.


Strength

If your giants can lift ~500 kg overhead most of the time, you
should give them a STR of +12 (LIFT = 560). On the other hand if you want
your giants to be only ~5 times stronger than the average human, then you
should give them an average STR of +6 (Strength Factor = 5.29).




Once again, the table is just a tool: you don't have to use it if you don't
wish to.




Base Speed

This is not an attribute but results directly from them. Decide which speed is
a logical result from its Talents and the species size. The base speed is
normally given in both meters/round and km/h. To find the speed in km/h,
multiply the speed in meters/round by 0.6. Inversely, to find the speed in
meters/round, divide the speed in km/h by 0.6.


Standard speeds









Human
km/hourm/roundOther SpeciesFatigue Rating


Base35In species description(1)
Walking6102*Base(1)
Running12204*Base(3)
Sprinting*24408*Base(7)
Max**366012*Base(10)





To decide which Base Speed is reasonable, look at the speed ratings for humans:

  -&gt; walking speed = Base Speed *2





  -&gt; running speed = Base Speed * 4





  -&gt; sprinting speed = Base Speed * 8





  -&gt; maximum speed = Base Speed * 12




This means that a species with a Base Speed of 6 meters/round walking at a
normal pace is as fast as a human who is jogging.



It is suggested that you specify the base, walking, running, sprinting and
maximum speeds in the species description, to simplify the life of game
masters and players. In  general, these speeds will be calculated from the
formulas above. If you want to use different formulas for your species, please
write them beside the calculated speeds.




For example, the quantum leap monster could have base speed of 30 meters/round
with a walking speed of 90 meters/round (Base Speed * 3) and a maximum speed of
120 meters/round (Base Speed * 4).




Natural Resistance

Natural Resistance (NR) represents the toughness of the species skin, tissues
and bones and their ability to withstand impact. It is the biological
equivalent of a suit of armor, which protects the character from cutting,
tearing and bludgeoning impacts.



A Natural Resistance of 0 corresponds to the resistance of the human skin,
tissues and bones. Smaller species will probably be more fragile, while bigger
ones will likely be more resistant. For humanoid species similar in
proportions to humans, it is recommended to set a Natural Resistance equal to
their Size Rating (SR) value (which can be found from the height of the species
in the Strength and Size Rating Table).



Note that Armor Resistance (the resistance of chain mail, ...) is the same
for every species, but that the resistance value used in combat is the sum
of the species Natural Resistance and the Armor Resistance.




Natural Resistance = Size Rating      (for humanoid species)




Innate ISB, Gifts and Foibles

IMHO this is one of the main reasons why players want to have characters from
another race. Each specific species has something that makes it unique:
Gifts that help them to survive and foibles that are the burdens layed on the
shoulders of that race. This combination may make it interesting to play a
member of this species.


ISB (= Innate Skill Bonus)

An innate skill bonus is a bonus to a skill that all members of a species
possess. This bonus is applied when a character has learned this skill
and uses it. Generally, Innate Skill Bonuses apply only to physical skills.



The EP cost for ISB is calculated by:

ISB Cost = ISB * (ISB+1) / 2 * Base EP Cost of Skill.



Innate Skill Bonus

Centaurs have an ISB +3 to running.
The skill costs 3.
This means the EP cost is: 3 * 4 / 2 * 3 = 18.




Gifts

A gift is an advantage that is innate to all members of a species. It is
normally a physical advantage. The cost of the gifts are logically added to
the EP cost.



Foibles

These are physical or even psychological disadvantages that make it more
difficult to play the character. Their 'cost' will be substracted from the
EP cost.




Calculating EP cost

Now you have all the informations that you need to calculate the species' EP
cost. As I mentioned above you will have to pay the EP cost when you create
a character from a specific race.



The EP cost is calculated by applying the following modifiers:



Sum all Talents modifiers. Add twenty times this value to the Species EP Cost (the result can be negative).
Add (Base Speed - Human Base Speed) * 5 (in meters per round)
Add Natural Resistance * 20
Add all costs for ISB
Add all costs for gifts
Substract all costs for foibles



Cultures

Now the statistic of the species are finished. These statistics should be
the same for all worlds in which this species will appear. The only
difference between the species on several worlds may be the cultures founded
by them. Add the cultures that will be the most likely formed by members of
this species. You find culture descriptions at the end of this book. They
need only to be adapted to this race. All the informations concerning
cultures will be given in the next chapter.



IMPACT done by a species weapons

Many humanoid species will use weapons that are scaled versions of human
weapons. For example, a pixie could wield a needle size sword and a giant
could use a club the size of a tree.



In order to maintain consistency across species, the IMPACT of such weapons
should be approximately equal to the sum of the IMPACT of the equivalent
human weapon and the species average Strength. The idea behind this scaling
is that a smaller and lighter weapon will do less damage than a larger one
of similar shape.




Species weapon IMPACT = Human weapon IMPACT + Species average STR



Species Weapon Impact

The IMPACT of a pixie bastard sword would be equal to:

Pixie bastard sword IMPACT = Human bastard sword IMPACT + Average Pixie STR
                           = 2d6 + 4                    - 20
                           = 2d6 - 16




(For those who find this value ridiculously small, pixies are 10 cm
creatures and their swords would do no more than a scratch to a human.)

Cultures

These creatures do not really have a society. Imps fit in with whatever plans
their baatezu masters dream up, and they follow these schemes to the best of
their abilities. They may be weak and low, but they are smart enough to know
that they had better do what they are told. That is the only way they can
advance.




Most importantly, imps realize that they have sidestepped one of the
most dangerous things about being a larva. By accepting the changes thrust upon
them, they avoid being turned into lemures, or other fodder for the Blood War.

The Lower Planes are full of larvae. Some of them are brought to the
attention of greater fiends and twisted into new and interesting forms.
When a baatezu twists a larva in just the right way, it becomes an imp.




The poor imps are rigidly regulated and watched over by their baatezu masters.
When a mortal is judged "worthy," the fiends may make a gift of an imp to that
poor basher. Oho! It is no good gift! From that point on, the imp starts to
corrupt the mortal and drag his heart, inch by inch, closer to the grasp of
the baatezu.



Chant is imps that do well can be turned into baatezu.
If one of these little creatures is willing to start small and work up through
the ranks, it could go far.



Imps are about 60 cm tall, have wings and can fly. They also have poison in
their bodies. A lucky imp can even take out a dragon with a well-placed sting.
An imp can change its shape into any two of these forms: large spider, raven,
goat, or giant rat.



Imps muddle through centuries of existence as neuter beings.
When they have done enough good jobs to please their masters, they are assigned
a gender according to the traits of their work.



Imps are usually too busy to sleep. Their fiend masters and their mortal
masters always send them out to do evil things. Many imps do not care;
they do not need sleep at all. But sometimes they get tired of running around
and they hide in one of their animal shapes so they can rest somewhere.



As far as food goes, imps eat whatever they can get, as long as it is meat.
The creatures do not care if the meat is alive or dead, or if it has been
steeped in fear or gehreleth slime. It just has to be meat.



When the baatezu twist larvae into imps, they wring a few special powers into
their new servants. All imps have a strange ability to sense if you have
something bad in mind, and they can turn invisible to hide from anything that
worries them. They also love fire, cold, and lightning. And Believe it or not,
these puny creatures are very resistant to magic.



But like baatezu they keep a good distance when it comes to anything made out
of silver. Good for them they have such an amazing regeneration rate.



Also, imps are good at talking other berks into doing things. Their tongues
are like Elysium honney-cookies, dipped in the poisonous waters of Vudra.



If slain off their home planes, imps just reform back home after a
year and a day. But if you kill an imp on Baator, they are blasted into
eternal oblivion.



Like most small infernal creatures, imps act weak to tough berks and tough to
weak ones. To those they serve, they are ingratiating and endlessly helpful.
But they lord their little might over any sods unfortunate enough to come under
their power.



Most of them are also very concerned about their potential advancement.
If you offer one a hand up on the food chain, you might earn its loyalty,
at least for a small time. But oho! These alliances don't last long,
and if you count that they will, you might as well count yourself right into
the dead-book, because that's exactly where the little horrors would like to
put you, mortal.

Ancient careers
Acrobat/Actor

Acrobats and Actors were important parts of Medieval life. The travelling
circus (as we still know it today) originated long before the Middle Ages and
was a great source of entertainment, morale and revenue for towns and cities.



As most people lacked formal education and could not read, actors were
important to portray various roles that told of topical and historical events.
Though not much training was available for these jobs, those who held the
positions were not highly regarded in social circles.

Apothecarist

An Apothecarist was one trained and skilled in the arts of formal medicine.
Though not as highly regarded as a physician, these workers devoted their time
and studies to the arts of healing. Trained physicians were expensive and
usually only retained and hired by kings, nobles and the elite. Therefore the
Apothecarist served the common people.



Commonly a monk or priest held the position and most available remedies came
from the natural uses of plants, herbs and roots. It is believed that most of
these practical applications were first discovered by the Celts and Druids.



An Apothecarist who was a member of a religious order often charged a donation
to his sect for his services. A layman who served in the same occupation could
charge whatever fees he or she wanted.

Architect

Architects built structures, towns and buildings. Not only did they possess the
knowledge to construct these things but they also had the skill to plan entire
cities. Architects were highly in demand and were paid high wages for their
services. As war spread across Europe during the Medieval Ages it was important
for a king to have an architect who could build strong, reliable and defensible
towns, buildings and castles.



Much of the Gothic architecture that stands today throughout Europe was built
during the Medieval Ages. Churches, castles, cathedrals and theaters were often
not only functional buildings, but statements of a king's wealth and power.



The Medieval Architect had to have skill in math and a creative mind. In many
cases is a city or castle was conquered by an enemy the architect would be put
to death. Having his buildings mastered by an enemy was the ultimate sign of
failure.

Armorer

The Medieval Armorer held a very important position in the workforce. Not only
were his skills highly required by nobles and monarchs, but the commoners
enlisted his services during times of war as well.



The Armorer was usually a blacksmith as well but as war became a more frequent
event, many blacksmiths could afford to relinquish their skills of crafting
metalworks and strictly pursue the field of making armor. It paid dearly for
them as a suit of armor could cost the modern equivalent of $60,000.00 -
$90,000.00 or even more! Armor had to be uniquely crafted to fit its wearer and
as such it was considered a specialty line of work.



Most Armorers were members of the Middle Class and were often very wealthy
indeed.

Artist

Artists were common during the Medieval Ages but only the best were conscripted
by kings, nobles and the elite to produce portraits. Preserving the images and
likeness of a person and his family served as a contribution to history and
future generations.



The Medieval Artist often went from town to town seeking business but once an
artist had a royal or noble commission and if his work was worthy, his career
was made. Perhaps the two most famous Medieval artists are Michaelangelo and
Leonardo da Vinci.



The mediums used by most Medieval Artists were varied. Most preferred oil-based
paints that were manufactured by mixing different agents into berry-dye.
Watercolors were also popular and enamel painting was in its early stages.

Astrologer

The study of the stars and planets was not a new science in the Medieval Ages
but it was regarded as being mystical. The Astrologer did not only use the
heavens as a reference but he or she also studied the earth, the weather cycles
and the seasonal patterns. It was believed that through these things a better
understanding could be gained for agriculture and other social successes.



Many astrologers posed various and opposing theories. Some claimed the earth
revolved around the sun, others claimed that it was the moon that revolved
around the earth. In fact, part of Christopher Columbus's journey to the
Americas in 1492 was partially to dispel a theory that the earth was flat.



Sometimes Astrologers were accused of practicing witchcraft as their studies
took them into unorthodox techniques and discoveries. The Druids were thought
to be the first to seek a true understanding of celestial bodies and experts
argue that the mystical Stonehenge is nothing more than a lunar calendar.

Baker

The Baker was a common occupation but not as easy as some may think. In the
Medieval Ages there was a period when bakers began cheating the public at such
a rate that public outcry reached the ears of several kings. As bread was a
daily staple of Medieval life, the bakers knew that they could charge a lot of
money for minimal portions of their products. As such, kings levied laws
against bakers stating that they were to lower their pricesand keep honest.
In fact the common term "A Baker's Dozen" (meaning 13 instead of 12) came from
this time period. Any baker caught selling less than an even dozen was strictly
and harshly punished. As a result bakers began adding one extra loaf to be
certain their count would be correct or even over the amount decreed by law.



Good bakers were often invited and employed by the rich and elite as personal
cooks and chefs inside the safety of castles. Their duties included the
preparation of dinners and large feasts. There were exceptional bakers of all
classes.

Barrister

The Barrister was a professional lawyer. Legal arbitration was popular during
the Medieval Ages as people challenged claims to land, inherited holdings and
even common law. Different provincial territories were usually subjected to the
laws of the local lord who governed them. As such, litigation could easily
arise between the residents of two neighboring communities.



Often a local priest would be consulted to act as a Barrister but as times
progressed people realized that there were high wages to be earned for the
skilled and professional lawyer. After much litigation and arbitration arose
and as disputes became difficult to settle under the umbrella of conflicting
laws, a new system for order was instituted. A policy called "The King's Law"
became the sole source of legal behavior permissable throughout sovereign
lands. Each successive king could change any law he deemed fit but the people
were bound legally to adhere to it.



Barristers became well respected during the Medieval Ages and helped to write
and form many of the laws that we still practice today.

Bookbinder

An occupation that was extremely important but receives very little credit is
the position of the Medieval Bookbinder. This skill was very important as
diaries, journals and manifests were being written during the time period.
News of discoveries, law, science, medicine, technology and industry were
recorded on paper and were then bound together in the format of a book by
professional binders.



As there were no machines for printing, each journal and book was meticulously
and painstakingly handwritten. The Bookbinder had to be careful when setting
the pages together to not tear, damage or destroy any portion of the
manuscript.



Many of these books still survive today in Churches and museums and serve as a
testament to the excellent work performed.



Bookbinders usually joined a guild where they learned the trade as an
apprentice.

Bowyer

The Bowyer (also called a Bower or Fletcher), crafted and manufactured bows,
arrows, crossbows and bolts. The effectiveness of the standard bow in combat
was first recognized by the Barbarian armies of Eastern Europe around 1070 AD.
But it was not until October 4, 1189 that Archers and bowmen established
themselves at the Battle of Acre and proved the quality of the bow as a weapon.



From that point forward, the bow became a standard weapon. It was easy to craft
by those who knew the skill and was readily affordable to most people. Bowyers
worked with a variety of woods and tools. A well crafted bow had durability and
even balance. The skill was much in demand and remained a premier trade until
the 1600s.

Brewer

The Brewer made and fermented beers and ales. The process was completed through
combining and aging hops, barley, wheat, malt and grain. The beverages were
served as a staple of daily life and were consumed in pubs, alehouses, taverns,
castles and homes.



During sieges and combat, historical documentation often tells of 'barrels of
beer' being delivered to the troops. The beverage was so important to the
fighting men that a document even states that at the Battle Of Sempach on July
9, 1386, the fighting actually stopped in mid-battle so that wagoneers could
deliver kegs and barrels of beer to each respective military.



Brewers were permitted their own enterprise during the Medieval Ages but since
their product was so highly in demand it often fell to heavy taxes and levies
being placed upon its sale and at times, even its consumption.

Bricklayer

Bricklaying was common labor and though it did not require vast knowledge or
skill, those who showed agility at the work were often subjected to an
abundance of employment and decent pay.



Often was the time when a king or noble would receive news that an approaching
enemy army was marching toward his towns and castle. The agile Bricklayers were
then conscripted to build retaining walls and obstacles and even reinforce the
towns and communities that were threatened.



Not only did war contribute to the benefit of the Bricklayer, but events such
as fires and floods were often left to his protection. By rapidly constructing
walls and ducts, it was possible to divert fires and floods and thus spare an
entire city, castle or town.



Bricklayers though quite common throughout the Medieval Ages were highly
respected members of their social orders.

Candlemaker

The Candlemaker was a specialist with many talents. Though making candles was
(and still is) a relatively easy project, the craftsman also had to have a
knowledge of the bees that provided him with the substance to complete his
work.



Once the wax was made a wick constructed of cord or twine was soaked in an
oil-based soltuion, inserted into the center of the wax mold and then the
candle was either pressed or shaped by hand. Candles provided illumination and
were also necessary for church ceremonies.



It's believed to have been in the 11th Century when a Candlemaker by the name
of Graham Overhill invented a candle with twelve markings (lines) on it.
When lit at the top of the hour, the candle would burn from line to line at the
rate of one hour each. Thus Overhill's candle served as a clock as well.




Though specific skills were required, candlemaking was an easy craft and it was
never known to provide more than a modest income.

Carpenter

Carpenters were highly skilled and considered to be elite tradesmen. To become
a Carpenter it was usually necessary to join a guild as an apprentice and learn
the craft.



Most items used during daily life in the Medieval Ages were produced and
manufactured by carpenters. Homes, wagons, tables, furniture, tools and
utensils were all the creations of these gifted workers.



Knowledge of math, woodworking and the use of tools was required. Though many
of the implements used were basic in comparison to those employed today, it can
be argued that some fine examples of work were produced during the Middle Ages.



Kings and nobles often sought out the finest carpenters and kept them retained
on their staffs as specialists. Furnishing castles and estates was not only
done for decorative purposes but also to demonstrate prestige and status to
visitors. Thus a master carpenter was always in demand and could stand to earn
high wages.

Cartographer

Cartographers (or map-makers) held a very important position in service to a
king or noble. As information of terrain and the oceans became known and
available, it was the job of the Cartographer to draw a detailed map of a given
area. These maps had to be accurate for many reasons. For example if a king
ordered his army to march into an enemy land he needed to know of land and
topographical features such as mountains, forests and rivers. Not only did
these places serve as barriers that were difficult for his troops to traverse,
but they also provided his enemies with advantageous places to launch ambushes
and attacks. As such, detailed maps were highly sought after. Also, it was
important to note new lands dicovered on ocean voyages as it gave kings the
opportunity to subjugate new areas.



Cartography was also important to distinguish boundries of neighboring kingdoms
or fifedoms. Sometimes devious nobles had false maps drawn and they allowed
them to 'slip' into the hands of their enemies.



The cartographer had to be an artist as well, versed in reading and writing and
skilled with math and geography.

Clothier

Clothing was not an available commodity to the lower classes and peasantry
until the 12th Century. In contrast, as the elite and members of the nobility
could afford the lavish prices of clothing, those who made garments (called
Clothiers) were sought after for their skills.



Being a Clothier meant having a knowledge of various materials and how to
assemble them into fine pieces of wear. The clothing of the time had to be
durable, fashionable and decorative as even during the Medieval Ages, clothing
was more of a status symbol.



The Clothier had to be experienced with mathematics, design and skill for
assembly. If serving the nobility a handsome profit could be made. But when
fabrics became available to all classes, the Clothier earned a modest living.

Cook

It seems that during any time period the position of a Cook was usually
thankless and difficult. The Medieval Ages were no exception. As methods for
preserving food were not invented to any degree of effectiveness, Cooks often
used salt to preserve meats and fish. The winter weather provided snow and ice
to act as refrigeration but often preparing a meal was no easy task.



Spices and extracts that we take for granted today were highly expensive during
the Medieval Ages. Trade routes were still being discovered and items such as
saffrin, ginger and cinnamon came from the Far East. Thus, a delicious meal was
usually enjoyed by only those who could afford the components to make one.



Feasts were held to commemorate holidays and important political events. These
meals were served to hundreds of guests and sometimes thousands.



It was necessary for the Cook to impress the friends of his lord or master.
There are many instances on record, such as the event in the year 1302 when Sir
Henry Campbell, master of Lamberth Castle, had his Cook imprisoned for serving
a meal that was considered poor.



Though a wide variety of foods were available in the Medieval Ages, a good Cook
only earned an average living with fair wages.

Diplomat

Those fortunate enough to possess the skills to become political Diplomats were
often on the road to nobility and positions of title. The Medieval Diplomat
served as a royal messenger and ambassador to the king, queen or noble he
served. Diplomats would often be sent on missions to speak on behalf of the
monarchy to rival kings or ruling houses. The Diplomat would negotiate
political deals such as peace treaties, hostage or prisoner releases and
matters of trade, commerce and economics.



The Diplomat needed to be firm, loyal and dedicated to the master he served and
it was also required that he have excellent speaking skills, the knowledge of
reading and writing and a shrewd manner.



If a Diplomat successfully delegated a trade or commerce pact he was often
entitled to a percentage of the revenue this new deal generated. Therefore
Diplomats were often wealthy people. However the astute Diplomat knew how to
negotiate deals that not only favored both rival parties but also was to his
own benefit. The Diplomat could reap financial reward from both factions if he
curtailed the deals to fit his own interests.



Often Diplomats were the educated members of the Upper Class and elite
societies. They often held titles such as Count, Duke or Baron and normally
retired with great wealth and prestige.

Dyer

Dyers used their skills to mix different components to form inks, dyes and
colorful stains that could add tint and hue to clothing, furniture, fabrics,
materials and artwork. Not only did they possess the ability to decorate
fashionable wear but they also provided scribes and artists with the materials
necessary for them to complete their work.



The Dyer had a multi-faceted job. Not only was the making of the various dyes
difficult and tedious work but often it was dangerous too. Different berries
and plants used to create the pigments often contained a degree of poison that
was lethal if handled, inhaled or accidentally ingested. Though the Dyer put
his or her life in jeopardy by working, the wages earned were quite meager and
below average.



Most women held the positions of Dyers and though some were elevated to
strictly work for the elite and nobility, most worked in small towns and
communities.

Engineer

Engineers are evident throughout history beginning in ancient Egypt and
reaching a position of prominent status in ancient Rome. These skilled
tradesmen were essential to the successful expansion of any political kingdom.
Not only were cities and towns improved by their skills but warfare and daily
life saw better odds with the meaningful contributions of Engineers.



Difficult tasks such as building expansion bridges, reinforcing the
subterranian foundations of castle walls, building powerful siege engines for
use in battle and even irrigation and aquaducts were a few of the jobs
Engineers were called upon to perform.



In the Medieval Ages without the refined tools, knowledge and materials
available today, the above tasks were considered monumental feats of
achievement. Not only did such things improve the morale and efficiency of a
kingdom but it also stood to prevent disease in the areas of plumbing and
rubbish removal and even served to be more productive in irrigating crops and
providing water.



Engineers did most of their work by 'trial and error' and though kings and
nobles recognized and acknowledged the wide margin for potential failure, such
could end the life or career of a skilled Engineer. Though many feats were
undertaken for the very first time, such enterprises were costly and put a
strain on the financial reserves of a kingdom. However, Engineers were highly
respected and were usually employed by the most rich and powerful kings and
queens of Medieval society.

Engraver

An Engraver was a specialist who was often called upon to etch messages and
designs into swords, shields, armor and metal plaques. An artist in his own
right, he worked with a variety of custom tools to produce his trade.



Though the artform has been modified by the advances in technology of today,
the Medieval Engraver practiced his craft in a most time consuming and
painstaking way. If the results of his work were unattractive or undesirable,
the customer would often not pay or even had legal grounds to sue the Engraver
for ruining a piece of private property. As such the Engraver had to produce
quality work.



Despite being a specialty, Engravers were quite common throughout the Medieval
Ages. The wages earned were generally modest but being conscripted or hired by
a noble or monarch for a custom project could find him the recipient of high
pay.

Farmer

Farming was the most popular occupation of the Medieval Ages as it was an
essential element to survival. A local lord or master would grant portions of
his land to commoners and serfs and in exchange the people would till,
cultivate and maintain the property to produce crops. What was grown was
eventually sold at local markets at which the peasants were allowed to keep a
share. Most revenue went to the local lord however through taxes and levies.



In the society of the Middle Ages, a man's status was based on how much land
and livestock he owned. As both of these elements were critical for revenue, a
private farmer who owned his own land could become quite rich.



Crops were varied and depended greatly on how fertile the plot of farmed land
was.

Fisherman

The Fisherman was much like the farmer in that he provided food as a commodity
and thus sustained the survival of towns and villages. Usually a professional
fisherman worked on a boat owned by a noble or local lord. The work would begin
at sunrise as the boats would depart to cast lines and nets into oceans, lakes,
rivers and causeways. Fish tended to fetch a higher price in the market because
of the rapid rate at which they deteriorated and spoiled.



A fisherman who had his own boat was not necessarily in a position to
capitalize on free enterprise. Though he was entitled to operate legally by
himself, most waterways were the legal right and claim of kings and nobles.
Therefore limits were imposed on the private fisherman as to how much bounty he
could haul out of the waters. Even then, higher taxes were assessed on him in
the markets to ensure that the regent or local master got his due share.

Forester

The Forester usually held a position equal to a sheriff or local law enforcer.
He was responsible for patrolling the woodlands on a lord or noble's property.
His duties included negotiating deals for the sale of lumber and timber and to
stop poachers from illegally killing animals in the forest.



Many times wanted criminals would flee their arrest warrants and seek the
safety of hiding in a forest. When this would occur it was the duty of the
Forester to oragnize roving gangs of armed men to flush out the criminal and
capture him.



Often Foresters held titles of prominence in their local communities and also
acted as barristers and arbitrators. Their pay was usually above average and
they could stand to make a decent and profitable living.

Fortune-teller

Fortune-tellers were often looked upon with disapproval from the ruling classes
but their services were highly in demand. The Medieval Ages were full of
superstition and very real belief in supernatural forces and powers. Most
things that could not be explained by science or technology was thought to be
the direct influences of these powers at work.



The common people were normally quite stressed economically and therefore they
viewed the Fortune-teller as a potential advantage to overcoming future
difficulties. If their future could be revealed they believed they could take
steps to improve upon it.



Most Fortune-tellers were common rogues and tricksters who used a variety of
simple illusions to create dramatic effects. Though they possessed no real
skill at all for devining the future, they would be careful to use basic events
and information to project a scenario that was generic enough to fit into
anyone's situation. Once embellished with mild promises of prosperity it seemed
a true magical experience had taken place. Often though the Fortune-teller's
success was based on how much the person getting the reading wanted to believe.



Some Fortune-tellers did use lunar and celestial patterns to predict probable
and basic outcomes in terms of weather. These natural signs could foretell
famine or draught or even bad storms. If a Fortune-teller had success in
predicting these events, his or her credibility was greatly enhanced.



A few kings and monarchs did enlist the services of seers and Fortune-tellers
to predict the future of their kingdoms and even the outcome of battles. Though
there was a given ratio of success and failure based on mathematical
probability, the fortune-tellers with luck and agility managed to earn
positions of respect and wealth in some courts.



However, most were treated as witches or dark practitioners. And in some cases
when their foretold events did not ring true, they were hunted down and killed.

Furrier

The Furrier worked with the pelts and hides from animals. not only did he use
the fur to make clothing but also rugs, blankets and even inner linings for
armor.



If a Furrier operated with wisdom he could become quite profitable in his
trade. Different regions produced different animals and with careful and legal
trapping he could import and export furs to different regions that were
considered exotic and hard to get.



Hides and pelts were treated in a variety of ways, usually by coating the
underside with an oil-based substance to protect it from deterioration. Then it
was usually hung in the sunlight or a dry area so the liquid could dry and act
as a sealant. The fur was treated with different powders and a liquid
containing lye. This preserved the fur for wuite a long time.



Though some furriers achieved great wealth the common occupation paid very
modestly.

Gardener

The Medieval Gardener was considered a specialist at his trade. He was mainly
responsible for the upkeep and cosmetic appearance of castles and estates but
he was also called upon to build defensive ditches and barriers during times of
war.



Throughout Europe there are many forms of ivy that grow wild. These plants tend
to grow upward along stonefaces and as such, castles were prime for this
problem. Enemies could use the sturdy ivy to climb and grapple the walls to
gain access. Therefore it was important to have a Gardener who could cut down,
trim and destroy these potentially dangerous plants.



A knowledge of herbs, plants and flowers was essential. Most Gardeners served
some form of nobility or local lord but even though a portion of their work was
critical to the safety and protection of a castle or estate, they were paid
meagerly.

Gravedigger

Unfortunately the Gravedigger could stand to make a profitable living during
the Medieval Ages. As epidemics, disease and war were rampant the Gravedigger
was never short on business.



During the Black Plague it was recorded that a Gravedigger named Marshal de
Clare reaped such a profit that he was able to afford estates, manors, castles,
land and livestock. Marshal de Clare later became a local lord, hired a retinue
of knights and became a lesser ruling house in Southern England.



No special skills were required for the profession but it did call for a
careful handling of the tools.

Herald

A Herald was not an occupation that someone trained for, but rather a job that
was usually the appointment by a king or noble. Most often a domestic servant
in a castle would be elevated in rank by receiving this appointment from his
master.



The Herald (or Harker) would declare announcements on behalf of the king to the
public. Normally this was done on a given day when the public would assemble at
the base of a castle tower and the Herald would shout out the news and
proclamations or the Herald would do his job in the local townsquare. It was
the responsibility of the Herald to inform the public of what was going on.
(Note that many newspapers to this day are called "The Herald")



The only requirements one needed to perform this job successfully was a good
speaking voice, the ability to read and write and obedience to a local lord.
Two of the most famous men in the Medieval Ages who held the role of a Herald
or Harker are Geoffrey Chaucer (author of the Canterbury Tales) and Nigel Gray.

Herbalist

A Herbalist was usually a member of a religious order such as a monk or friar.
His main duties included the planting and maintaining of medicinal plants,
roots and herbs. Different from a Gardener in that he didn't maintain large
estates or actively participate in forming defensive ditches, the Herbalist
enveloped himself in the deep studies of medicine.



Many herbs have natural healing agents and as medicine was still in its early
stages, the Medieval Herbalist was a much respected person. Normally the church
would provide a plot or tract of land that was cultivated by either religious
personnel or by peasants who received minor wages. The Herbalist would then
plant and maintain his select crops in the area.



A lot of the plants needed to undergo treatments such as boiling, drying,
steeping or steaming to bring out their healing properties and some needed to
be combined with others to find the desired results. The Herbalist therefore
had an elaborate and involved study and needed the components of a laboratory
to do his work successfully.



Those who belonged to religious orders usually did not stand to make high wages
as they were bound by laws of poverty. However a layman who acted as his own
Herbalist could sell his healing knowledge and services for extremely high
prices.

Hunter

The professional Hunter of the Medieval Ages had many resources at hand with
which he could earn money. Hunting was a special skill and though most people
had the basic knowledge needed for survival, professionals often circulated
among the elite nobility.



Hunting was a popular sport during the Medieval Ages but also extremely
dangerous. Kings and lords would hire a professional Hunter to lead their
party. Often they would hunt for animals such as wildboar, wolves or even bear.
Naturally the more tame animals such as deer, rabbits and foxes were the
targets of the general populace but there are many stories from the Medieval
Ages of nobles being killed during the more dangerous hunts.



Not only did the Hunter serve as a guide and expert, but he also had a
knowledge of skinning, tanning and preparing the meats that were captured on
the hunt. Also, he even managed to use the bones of the captured animals to
make products such as dagger hilts and used the teeth for jewelry and other
exotic items. As a result, the Hunter not only made a profit from hiring out
his services, but also made additional money from his skills and resourceful
talents.

Innkeeper

One of the most lucrative and profitable occupations was that of the Medieval
Innkeeper, but only if all conditions were prime and if certain circumstances
were maintained.



Anyone who could afford the structure and property could embrace the free
enterprise of having an Inn, however he or she was subject to heavy taxes and
levies by the local lords of the area.



Owning an Inn carried a lot of responsibility. Besides the bedrooms the Inn
also had other internal features such as a dining rooms and often a tavern or
alehouse. Usually the fare for a room included meals as well. The alehouse was
sometimes leased by a secondary business person and often a separate enterprise
from the Inn.



Cleaning, maintaining and providing quality goods and services were the primary
requirements of an Innkeeper. One also had to be good with mathematics and
money and even have the presence of mind to calculate bookings and the ordering
of supplies and inventory. Most times an Innkeeper hired a small staff of armed
security guards. It was not uncommon for a group of fighters to arrive at an
Inn shortly after their latest campaign. Rowdy and hoping to spend the spoils
of war, the atmosphere inside most Inns and alehouses could be bawdy and even
at times violent.



At the doorway to an Inn you could find at least one armed guard posted. There
was usually a minimal entry fee to pass through the door, just a courtesy to
help pay for any damages that may arise while inside. The guard at the door
would take a brass or copper coin from the entrant and bounce it on a wet piece
of wood. If the coin bounced once it was clear that the coin was genuine and
the person was allowed to enter. Many times people would forge their own coins
out of lead or cheaper metals and since Europe saw a wide variety of foreign
money, it was often difficult to prove the authenticity of a coin. The practice
of bouncing the coin off of a wet piece of wood is what eventually led to
modern day doormen at bars and pubs being called "Bouncers".



Many times nobles and elite personnel were exempt from paying any fees at an
Inn or hostel. Though this was resented by most Innkeepers, they did receive
fair protection in return. If the business was maintained properly, an
Innkeeper could earn high profits.

Interpreter

Interpreters earned excellent wages despite whom they worked for. There was a
scarcity of people versed in more than one language and as a result,
Interpreters were highly sought after by kings and monarchs. Not only did an
Interpreter serve to reveal information about captured foreign troops, but also
he could compose letters, laws and doctrines that helped with the subjugation
of foreign territories.



Also it was necessary throughout the Medieval Ages to hold meetings,
conversations and diplomatic gatherings with nobles and ruling members of many
foreign countries. Therefore the Interpreter held an elite position and was
often given rank, land and titles in exchange for his or her valuable services.

Jester

The Jester seldom had an easy job. Though some were professionals and made
their livings touring from kingdom to kingdom, most were forced into the
position as an act of humiliation.



King Henry V often enjoyed taking captured Knights of elite title and rank and
forcing them to play the fool before his entire court. If the Jester was
successful at entertaining his troops and guests, he would be hauled back to
the dungeons after his performance to live to do it again another day. If the
Jester did not provide gleeful entertainment he was often tortured or killed.



Jesters lived precariously and often their success depended solely on the mood
of their audience. They did not earn high wages but were often allowed a few
benefits and luxuries of life inside a castle.

Jeweler

Jewelers held great positions of status within Medieval communities and towns.
As foreign wars took troops into exotic lands they often returned with precious
stones and minerals. Not knowing the value of them, it was up to the Jeweler to
determine their worth.



Diamonds, emeralds, rubies and sapphires were the most common stones found
during the Medieval Ages. Gold, silver and bronze were also held in high
regard. The Jeweler not only held the knowledge of assessing values on these
items but he was also skilled in setting the stones into rings, pendants,
medallions, bracelets and amulets. The Jeweler also knew how to set the items
into sword hilts and other placements that exhibited the status and wealth of
their holders.



Jewelers were respected but there were many who knew the advantages of being
less than honest. Stones with minimum value such as quartz, zarconia and even
fools gold were not easily distinguished by the untrained eye of the public.
Therefore it was common for a Jeweler to accept a valuable diamond with the
promise of setting it into a ring or pendant for its owner. Simply, he would
polish a quartz or zarconia of similar size and dupe the owner by giving him
the worthless item. The Jeweler could then sell the original and more valuable
stone and reap a quick and high profit.

Leatherworker

Leatherworkers were common laborers but their skills were in high demand. The
crafting of swordbelts, clothing, saddles and even leather armor were necessary
items for Medieval life.



Though some preferred the protection and skill that guilds provided, many were
able to learn the basics of the trade on their own.




The tanning process was relatively simple and though most commoners knew how to
do this, the products they made on their own didn't have the durability of
those made by Leatherworkers.



In order to be preserved, leather had to be treated by a series of steps.
Tanning, hiding and even treating the material with oils and softeners were
necessary to make it last longer and worth the money charged.



Leatherworkers earned a modest and sometimes decent living depending on the
quality of their skills.

Locksmith

Locksmiths were integral parts of Medieval society. Though most homes held
little more than an internal wooden slide lock on the insides, Locksmiths
became important with the developments and security of castles.



Their talents were in the beginning stages but an intricate lock that resisted
the efforts of picking or tampering was soon highly valued. Criminals and the
residents of dungeons often escaped rather easily when not secured with locks
or shackles. To maintain security Locksmiths were trained in guilds and the
secrets of their craft were kept highly guarded.



As such, Locksmiths were considered to possess the knowledge and skills of a
specialty organization and as a result earned high wages.

Merchant

Merchants needed to be wise in mathematics and negotiations. To trade goods and
services a Merchant needed to build a list of customers. And once established
he needed to maintain quality and timely service to keep them happy.



Most travelling merchants either sold grain, wheat, barley, oats, hops or other
commodities that could benefit a town or community. There was much competition
in this trade and a ruthless manner was often held between rival merchants.
Once the customer base was established it was important to maintain a decent
business ethic. Merchants often grew to be very wealthy and retired with
positions of title and rank.

Messenger

Another popular phrase of today that stemmed from the Medieval Ages is "Don't
kill the messenger". The occupation of a Messenger was often dangerous but had
its merits.



Usually the Messenger was a lesser diplomat of sorts and spent his time in
service to a king or local lord. When news or a response to an inquiry needed
to be delivered to a rival ruling house it was the job of the Messenger to
undertake the duty.



When the message delivered was less than favorable the Messenger was often the
victim of the incurred wrath. Often times the Messenger would be inadvertently
blamed and either imprisoned or killed. This led to lesgislation and laws being
passed which eventually made the Messengers exempt from punishment due to the
news they delivered.



Messengers had to be skilled in topographical knowledge, horsemanship and had
to be articulate. They needed the skills of reading and writing and often
received high wages for their dangerous services.

Miner

Miners also held very dangerous jobs and often worked in extremely precarious
environments. The need to mine gold and silver was paramount as most kingdoms
increased their financial reserves by depending on these resources. Miners were
not overly skilled workers but it did require a bold resiliance to perform the
duties.




Apart from the collapsing of mines, deadly gasses and cave-ins, the Miner had
to endure several days at a time beneath ground. His wages were above the
standard pay in exchange for his difficult services but often Miners led modest
lives.

Minstrel

Minstrels were musicians. Various instruments included the mandolin, fife,
flute, dulcimer, drums, violin and harpsichord. A great deal of skill and
training was required to become a professional musician and those lucky enough
to have proficiency on an instrument often found themselves entertaining kings
and nobles for high wages.



Minstrels often would record the deeds of heroic knights and go from tavern to
tavern playing these odes of homage. Not only did it make for an interesting
song, but it gave the knight publicity and established a degree of respect and
staus for him. Throughout the Medieval Ages, Bards became the popular employees
of any knight or common man who wanted their deeds enshrined in a public song.
The deeds were embellished of course but it was a wonderful way to spread the
fame of a knight from kingdom to kingdom. The talented Minstrels and Bards
frequently charged high prices for these services.

Moneylender

Banking was still in its developmental stages during the Medieval Ages but
there was always work to be found for a professional Moneylender. As kings
needed to increase their private funds to hire armies and finance campaigns,
they often sought the services of such an individual.



The Moneylender was able to set his own rules and since he was offering his
personal finances, he was often exempt from taxes and levies. His money was
often referred to as his "interest" being that it was the primary element of
his business. When lending money he would make his profit by charging a
percentage of the sum he was lending, to be paid back with the total owed.
Therefore if he lent 100 gold pieces to someone, he could charge 25% on his
"interest" and he would eventually receive 125 gold pieces back. His rates of
"interest" could vary and if a debtor could not repay the loan, the Moneylender
was entitled to seize land, livestock and holdings equal to what was owed.



The term "interest" still survives today and is commonplace with banks and
financial institutions. The Moneylender often made a lavish living.

Navigator

The Navigator usually worked closely with a Cartographer. His sole job was
steering vessels on a safe and even path to new destinations. Mainly they kept
their bearings and charted their courses by using reference points in the skies
by means of planets or stars. As they held steady positions in relation to the
earth, it was often easy for a trained Navigator to practice his trade.



Navigators also worked on the ground, guiding armies, troops, diplomats and
messengers through various features of terrain. Their services were highly
regarded and as a result they were well paid.

Though it is commonly believed that most Medieval towns and cities were quite
drab, this is a misconception. Communities were often highly decorated with
wreaths and color. The professional Painter was regarded as a tradesman who
could bring new residents to a community and also keep morale high by providing
an attractive place to live.



Festivals and tournaments saw great need for the Painter as his services were
in demand to produce lively environments. Though some skill was required it was
basically a trade that did not demand any formal training. Painters earned
modest wages but when conscripted by the service of kings or nobles, could make
a hefty profit.

Peddler

The Peddler was a common merchant and often went from town to town selling
whatever goods he had to offer. The items could be anything from novelty items
to candles or even tourist-styled souveniers.



Usually the Peddler was an enterprising business person but often stood to make
meager earnings as their profits were subjected to high taxation by the lords
and nobles of the communities they did business within.



One seldom found a rich Peddler and often it was a means of basic survival.

Physician

Physicians were very highly regarded and respected. Though their positions were
deemed prominent it took about a full century before their work was completely
accepted.



More skilled than an Apothecarist or Herbalist, the Physician was capable of
prescribing new medicines and performing types of surgery. These services were
often limited and dependant on the heavy purses of the rich and elite and as
such, many a commoner and peasant died simply because they could not afford the
services.



The Physician saw much opposition to his career during the 13th Century. Many
of his practices such as bleeding, lancing and surgical techniques were deemed
to be against the teachings and doctrines of Church Law. Therefore anyone wise
enough to know they needed the professional services of a Physician knew also
that they could risk punishment or excommunication by the Church.



During the 14th Century though the Church gradually began to accept the
merciful work of Physicians and they became wealthy and earned elaborate
lifestyles.

Playwright

Playwrights were necessary for many reasons. Good ones were difficult to find
and those who enjoyed success at this trade were continually hired by kings and
monarchs on a regular basis.



As most people could not read or write during the Medieval Ages, it was
important to act out history or crucial events in the form of a play. This
preserved history and gave the common people an understanding of how things
were gained and achieved.



The Playwright wrote his texts in the format of scripts and then hired Acrobats
and Actors to fill the roles. Often these performances would take place in
townsquares or anywhere in which a public audience could assemble. Many
Playwrights attempted controversial issues as the subject matter for their
plays and were subsequently arrested, imprisoned or executed. The wise
Playwright hovered around topics that were favorable by kings and law and
enjoyed great success and high wages.



Though at the end of the Medieval Ages, William Shakespeare (born 1564) was the
most popular Playwright of the time period.

Politician

Medieval Politicians served in many different capacities. Whereas a local lord
ruled the lands of his fifedom, the local people were often allowed to elect
their own sheriffs, mayors and delegates to handle matters on smaller levels.
All matters of grave importance though were left to the decisions of
arbitrators, barristers and of course the local lord himself.



A Sheriff was a minor political post that carried great weight and authority.
Often answerable to the local lord his duties included the enforcement of law
throughout the local communities.



The Mayor was the voice of the people. Any concerns of the commoners were put
forth to the Major and either he could resolve the matters personally or seek
the counsel of a barrister or his local lord.



Delegates operated between the Sheriff and Mayor and often were directly in
contact with the people. When concerns or issues were raised the Delegates
would call meetings between the Sheriff and Mayor and attempt to resolve the
matters. The entire system was subject to the law of the local lord but many
times these lesser legislative bodies were effective in their duties.



Wages varied but usually Politicans had above average livings.

Potter

Potters were crafters of earthenworks and dealt mainly in clay molds,
porcelains and early forms of ceramics. Basically they produced pots for
cooking and storage and at times sculpted icons and statues to order.



Potters were usually members of guilds and worked closely with molds, tools and
heating kilns. Their craft was well respected and though their products were
much in demand on a daily basis, their wages were usually average.

Rat Catcher

Though the very name of this position seems like a menial occupation, Rat
Catchers were very highly regarded in Medieval society and in fact, their work
was rather respected.



Rats, mice and vermin were often the cause of epidemics and disease. Therefore
a crafty and skillful Rat Catcher could earn stunning wages in ridding a city
or town of its pest problems. Often the work did take the professional Rat
Catcher into undesirable places and he did risk his own health and safety by
coming into contact with diseased and often rabid rodents.



However when he was successful at his trade he managed to gain local confidence
and increase his personal revenue. The Black Plague which killed over one-third
of Europe's population was mainly spread by the infected fleas that were
carried by rodents. Rat Catchers employed cats and means of trapping to bring
the problem under control and end one of the greatest and most damaging
epidemics to ever spread across an entire continent.

Sailor

Sailors often led lonely and hard lives and it was a most difficult occupation
during the Medieval Ages. It required a firm will and dedication as vessels
would often set sail for months or even a year at a time.



During voyages Sailors each had specific duties equal to the level of their
station. Overseeing the operation of a vessel at sea was difficult enough but
Sailors were constantly at work from sunrise to sunset. This served to keep the
Sailor busy and keep him from growing bored and discontented by the long hours
at sea.



Before the official formations of Navies, Sailors mainly sailed on ships owned
by kings, nobles and monarchs. Their pay was based on their rank. A common
Sailor earned very little while a First Mate or Boatswain earned much more
substantial wages.



Sailors needed training in the handling of the vessel, their duties at sea and
even ocean combat. The Sailor did not come into his full respect until the
advent of the Crusades when he became an important and key figure. Sailors
ferried troops, supplies, horses and foodstores from secured ports, through
hostile waters and resupplied the armies. Sailors were often a unique breed and
their main goal was to eventually reach Officer and receive command of their
own vessel.

Scribe

To become a Scribe required skills in reading, writing and comprehension.
Scribes not only wrote volumes of works on the Medieval Ages but were also
often asked to research laws and other matters for kings and nobles.



The Scribe was often a historian, poet and philosopher. His acquired knowledge
was advantageous at the workings of social interaction and his skills provided
a written overview of the time period.



Scribes usually were of nobility in that the education needed to attain the
post was not affordable or available to peasant and common classes. Most
Scribes came from religious abbeys where the skills were learned within the
vast libraries of the church.



Their wages were usually standard and average, however the Scribe was entitled
to all the benefits and luxuries of castle life.

Servant

There were advantages and disadvantages of being a domestic Servant. Though the
work was often tedious, menial and hard it was worthwhile if you were in
service to a kind lord or master. However, the difficult work when coupled with
a rude or abusive employer often led to harship throughout a Servant's life.



Usually Servants were conscripted if they possessed talents and abilities that
were useful inside a castle. Such things as cooking, baking, sewing, dying,
weaving or performing music could attract the attentions of a local lord. If
these conditions were met and the service was satisfactory, the Servant enjoyed
the mild benefit and protection of working within a castle.



Sometimes victorious knights would take their prisoners back to their homelands
and endenture them as Servants. This could be most embarrassing if the capture
person was an enemy knight. But while waiting to be ransomed or in order to
work off his debt, the enemy knight had no other choice but to lower himself to
the dutiful position of a Servant.

Shipwright

The Shipwright (or Shipwane) was a skilled specialist who built and designed
boats and vessels. The most prominent and effective design came out of the Dark
Ages with the Viking Longboat. Modifications to that ship led to more
successful and safe sea journeys.



Having great knowledge of mathematics, design and science, the Shipwright was a
master craftsman. Often earning high wages and a lavish living, their services
were often demanded by kings and monarchs.



Their craft was in demand throughout the entirety of the Medieval Ages and
Shipwrights gained more respect in England when their designed vessels defeated
the Spanish Armada, a flotilla deemed unable of conquer.



Guilds usually provided the training but once a person achieved the status of a
Shipwright his future was guaranteed to be profitable.

footwear. Anything from shoes fashioned from burlap, hide or leather to

necessary but as the materials they worked with fetched high prices, not all
were able to afford them.



Shoemakers eventually curtailed their businesses to suit the needs of most
people and designed lesser pieces of footwear from cloth and even wood. Though
they appealed to the mass populace and even though their product was necessary,
Shoemakers often earned only average wages.

Spy

It was a wise king or monarch that kept informed of what was going on in rival
and neighboring communities and towns. Therefore it became necessary to hire
Spies to secretly find out what was afoot.



Contrary to popular belief, most Spies were women. It was generally accepted
that women could move in certain social circles more easily than men and using
their inherent charm, could naturally coax more information out of trusted
employees of rival houses.



These Spies were often trained with the uses of various skills such as reading,
writing and often speaking more than one language. They were also trained
assassins and took oaths that obligated them to take their own lives rather
than risk being caught by an enemy.



Spies were usually paid high wages and were given the luxuries of castle life.

Stone Carver

Stone Carvers were important in Medieval society. Their work consisted of a
broad range of talents from etching tombstones to carving tools and statues.



Members of this profession usually acquired their skills through joining a
guild. The guild also included masons and sometimes bricklayers, but normally
Stone Carvers were in a grouping of their own.



Most of their work took great durations of time to perform and it was often
necessary to retain a Stone Carver for many months. The crafty ones knew how to
further extend each project and though they produced quality work, they could
thus earn more money.



Their wages were usually higher than average and a Stone Carver could earn a
decent living.

Storyteller

Storytelling was an integral part of Medieval life. As most people lacked the
ability to read and write, history, legends and folklore were passed along from
generation to generation through skilled Storytellers.



No special abilities were acquired to hold this position except for a decent
memory. However, the more industrious Storytellers also knew how to read so
that they could widen their collection of stories. Sadly, a great number of
Storytellers often embellished facts and added untrue elements to make their
stories more exciting and incredible. While this provided entertainment for
their audiences, historical facts often became distorted.



On average, Storytellers did not usually earn wages for their services unless
they were hired to perform at social gatherings. A few though did manage to
earn modest livings at the craft by entertaining kings and monarchs.

First developed in antiquity, "modern" plate armor (with well fitted and moving
parts) was first used by the Iranians (Parthians) about a thousand years before
it came into general use in Europe from the 13th century onward.
Plate had become the standard form of armor by the late 15th century, replacing
chain mail. Plate was just that, a sheet of metal (about as thick as that used
to make cars in the 1950s) and formed into a breat plate (front and back) a
flexible metal "skirt" as well as articulated coverings for the arms and legs.
Atop it all was a helmet and face place, as well as metal shoes and gauntlets.

These all fitted together in such a way as to overlap, leaving few vulnerable
points. The heaviest suit known weighed about 90 pounds, belonging to
Duke Ferry of Lorraine, who was killed at Agincourt in 1415, but most weighed
about 70 pounds. Plate armor was made to order, thus it was very expensive,
costing from 10,000 to 50,000 ducats depending on how complete and fancy the
suit was. Sort of like the various classes of luxury automobiles nowadays.
Because each suit was made to the measurements of the user, the weight was
evenly distributed and was not as cumbersome as one would think. As 20th
century experiments revealed, college atheletes (selected to fit in 15th
century suits of armor) could lie down and jump to a standing position, do
jumping jacks, and mount a horse with no trouble. A modern infantryman often
totes as much or more equipment into action as did a medieval knight, and most
of the grunt's gear is carried on his back, nor does he have a horse to help
him.

Location(s): This is a maritime adventure with possibility of piracy. The
  technology can be called enlightened medeval. The naval technology reaches
  out into the 18th century as far as sailing technology is concerned. There
  is no gun powder, however, so there are no guns or cannons. The world has no
  moon, instead it has a second sun which is somewhat brighter than the moon
  illuminating the sky at very dark levels of twilight illumination when the
  yellow sun is absent from the night sky. The year is 400 days long with each
  season lasting 100 days. There are no months since there is no moon. There
  is also an 80 year climate cycle called the grand season, this is due to
  that second orange sun. At the time of this adventure the world is in its
  second year of grandsummer about 10 days into local spring. The origins of
  the use of the metric system in an otherwise medeval setting are lost in the
  mists of time and legend.
Time: 10 days into spring, second year of grandsummer.
Participants: Player Characters, Pirates, seamonsters
Background: 
Plot sketch: A map to a treasure is found, location of treasure is at an
  abandoned castle.
Notes: More details will be forthcoming.
