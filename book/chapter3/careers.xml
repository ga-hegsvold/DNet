<para>
Choosing a Career does not limit a character to a certain set of Skills
exclusively, nor prevent a character from gaining Skills outside their Career
areas. The character will simply have more starting EPs in Skills within their
Career areas. There is nothing to prevent, for example, a Hunter character
from learning Skills from the Magic area at some later time, provided he has
the needed EP.
</para>

<para>
The percentile breakdown of the total EP gained in a particular Career is
listed after each Skill. The character will gain a total of 20 EP each month
the first five years of the Career. The next five years he gains a total of 10
EP each month. After these ten years he will gain a total of 5 EP each month.
