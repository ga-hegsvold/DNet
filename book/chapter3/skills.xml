<sect2><title>Untrained Penalty</title>
<para>
When a character attempts a Task for which he has not been Trained 
(Skill Competency is 'No Skill'), or to which no Skill is related,
he suffers an Untrained Penalty (UP).
</para>

<para>
Some Skills will have a special UP of Impossible. This indicates that
the Skill cannot be attempted when Skill Competency is 'No Skill'.
</para>

<para>
<literal>
UP = 5
</literal>
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>
Optional:
The UP is generally equal to 5 but can be changed by the GM.
The GM may set a higher UP for a Task that is normally performed using a Skill
requiring a lot of knowledge or practice (Difficult and Very Difficult Skills).
In the same way, the GM may reduce or eliminate the UP for Tasks that are
primarily based on Talents (ex: holding one's breath), or that do not benefit
much from knowledge or practice (Trivial and Easy Skills).
</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>
As a guideline, a UP of twice the Base Cost of the related Skill is suggested
for Tasks that are normally performed using a Skill.
</emphasis>
</para>

UP = 2 * BC

<sect2><title>Bying Skills</title>
<sect3><title>Skill Acquisition</title>
<para>
The following table can be used to look up the EP cost for advancing a Skill
from a Training Level of 0 to the desired Training Level in one step. This
table is most useful when creating a character and buying skills for the first
time.
</para>

<para>
Skill Acquisition Formula:
</para>

<para>
<literal>
EP Cost = Desired Tr Lvl * (Desired Tr Lvl + 1) * BC / 2
</literal>
</para>

<para>
<example><title>Skill Acqusistion</title>
<screen>
If Argis the ranger wants to start his Tracking Skill (BC = 4 EP)
at Training Level 8, he must spend:

EP Cost = Desired Tr Lvl * (Desired Tr Lvl + 1) * BC / 2
        = 8 * 9 * 4 / 2 = 144 EP

</para>

<sect3><title>Artistic Skills</title>
<formalpara><title>Acting</title>
<para>
Confers the ability to convincingly portray a character either from a literary
work or of one's own creation. This includes improvisational acting.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Disguise</title>
<para>
Confers the ability to alter one's general appearance in order to avoid
identification and deceive opponents. Encompasses alteration of height,
weight, posture and/or facial and body features. Often combined with the
Acting Skill.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Art</title>
<para>
Confers the ability to draw and paint life-like images as well as
impressionistic images.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
Confers proficiency in an instrument of choice.
</para>

<para>
Confers the ability to shape and mold clay, stone and wood into life-like
images of various sizes and compositions.
</para>

<formalpara><title>Ventriloquism</title>
<para>
Confers the seeming ability to project one's voice so that it appears to
emanate from inanimate objects, other people, or unusual locations. Good for
party tricks and for starting ale-house brawls.
</para>
</formalpara>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Athletic Skills</title>
<formalpara><title>Acrobatics</title>
<para>
Confers the ability to swing from a chandelier, somersault through a stained
glass window, and land on one's horse, ready to make a getaway. Can be used
in combat to dodge or reduce the effects of a blow.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
Enables the reduction of falling damage by such methods as slowing the rate
of descent by incidental surface contact, harm minimising impact postures,
and "dodging the spikes/aiming for the soft bits."
</para>

<para>
Enables safe transition along a strong rope strung between two points or any
similarly narrow and (generally) high-up path.
</para>

<formalpara><title>Climbing</title>
<para>
Lets a character scale vertical and near vertical surfaces such as smooth
walls and rough cliff-faces. Harder with slippery or featureless surfaces or
if burdened with accoutrements. Often combined with the Medicine Skill. :)
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Contortion</title>
<para>
Enables the manipulation of one's body in order to move through small
openings, hide in absurdly small containers or edifices, and escape from
bonds.
</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Endurance</title>
<para>
Enables prolongation of application with regard to physically demanding
and/or mentally draining tasks. A swimmer nears exhaustion towards the end
of long swim; they apply their endurance skill, and if successful, can
continue swimming anew, as if refreshed for half as long again. Successive
uses of the skill increase task difficulty and reduce prolongation span.
</para>
</formalpara>
