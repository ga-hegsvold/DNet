</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title><emphasis>Maximum Starting Tr Lvl (Optional)</emphasis></title>
<para>
<emphasis>
Listed as an optional rule to control how much Training a player can
acquire for a Skill at character creation. It simulates the fact that at
lower Experience Levels a character has not had enough time to develop
Skills to high Levels of mastery. In particular, harder Skills would not
have been developed as much as the easier Skills. If GMs have no problem
with characters beginning with Skills starting out at any Training Level,
then they can ignore this option.
</emphasis>
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
<emphasis>
The numbers in the table indicate the maximum Training Level a character
may advance a given Skill to start with.

<screen>
<emphasis>
If a character were just starting out, and wanted to learn Cooking (a low cost
Skill with 1 EP Base Cost) and Armorer (a more difficult Skill with 4 EP Base
Cost), he could advance Cooking to a maximum Training Level of 10 (at a cost of
55 EP), and Armorer to a maximum Training Level of 4 (at a cost of 40 EP).
