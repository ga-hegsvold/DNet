Title: (Not yet decided upon a title)
Author: Tom
Game World: (?)
Location(s): This is a maritime adventure with possibility of piracy. The
  technology can be called enlightened medeval. The naval technology reaches
  out into the 18th century as far as sailing technology is concerned. There
  is no gun powder, however, so there are no guns or cannons. The world has no
  moon, instead it has a second sun which is somewhat brighter than the moon
  illuminating the sky at very dark levels of twilight illumination when the
  yellow sun is absent from the night sky. The year is 400 days long with each
  season lasting 100 days. There are no months since there is no moon. There
  is also an 80 year climate cycle called the grand season, this is due to
  that second orange sun. At the time of this adventure the world is in its
  second year of grandsummer about 10 days into local spring. The origins of
  the use of the metric system in an otherwise medeval setting are lost in the
  mists of time and legend.
Time: 10 days into spring, second year of grandsummer.
Participants: Player Characters, Pirates, seamonsters
Background: 
Plot sketch: A map to a treasure is found, location of treasure is at an
