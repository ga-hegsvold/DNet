<para>
The process of resolving a Task is called Task Resolution. It is done via a
roll of the dice. The applicable Skill is then added to the die roll and the
result must be greater than or equal to the TD set by the GM.

Thus the standard Task Resolution Formula is:
</para>

<para>
<literal>
d10-d10* + Skill &gt;= TD
</literal>
</para>

<para>
If situational modifiers reduce a Task Difficulty to 10 less than the Skill,
a Task Resolution roll is not required; the outcome is an automatic success.
</para>

<para>
Similarly, and especially in non-crisis situations, a GM may waive the
requirement for a task resolution roll when a character's skill rating is
5 points over the TD rating e.g., Skill 6, TD 1.
