<para>
When many characters unite their strength, intelligence, etc. to accomplish
a Task, they are often more efficient than if they were trying to
accomplish the Task independently. In such a situation, the success of the
attempted Task is obtained by having each character roll independently
against the TD. The TD is lowered by 1 for every character working on the Task
beyond the first.

The Task Resolution Formula for each character is therefore:
</para>

<para>
<literal>
d10-d10* + Skill &gt;= TD - (N-1)
</literal>
</para>

<para>
where <literal>N</literal> is the number of characters attempting the Task.
</para>

<para>
The Task is successful if at least one of the characters makes his roll.
</para>

<para>
The GM must decide, based on the Task, if more than one character can
attempt the Task. If he decides that more than one character can attempt 
the Task, he must then decide the maximum number of characters that can 
take part in attempting the Task.
