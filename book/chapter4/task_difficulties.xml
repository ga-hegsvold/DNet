<para>
To aid the GM in determining TDs, the following TDs have been established
relative to what an average character (Tal = 0) with minimal Training in a Skill
(Tr Lvl = 1) can accomplish. Therefore, the values were derived from the
following Task Resolution Formula:
</para>

<para>
<literal>
d10-d10* + 1 &gt;= TD
</literal>
</para>

<para>
Thus, when assigning a difficulty to a Task, the GM should set the TD as if the
Task was being attempted by a Tal = 0, Tr Lvl = 1 character.
The GM should not base the difficulty on the Skill Level of the character
attempting the Task. In other words, figure out what the Task is like, then use
the table below to find the description that best fits the Task.
With this description, use the TD value listed.
</para>

<para>
<example><title>Task Difficulties</title>
<screen>
Climbing a moss covered wall by someone with Tal = 0, Tr Lvl = 1
could be described as tricky. Tricky is listed under the "Could also be
described as" column for Difficult. The TD associated with a Difficult
Task is 5. Thus no matter what the Skill of a character attempting to
climb a moss covered wall, the Task Difficulty is 5.

If a character with Skill 3 in Climb Walls attempts to climb the moss
covered wall, he uses the formula: d10-d10* + 3 &gt;= 5.

If a character with Skill 10 in Climb Walls attempts to climb the moss
covered wall, he uses the formula: d10-d10* + 10 &gt;= 5.
