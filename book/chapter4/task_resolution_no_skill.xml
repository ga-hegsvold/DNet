<sect1><title>Task Resolution when No Skill is Used</title>
<para>
If a character attempts a Task for which he does not possess a Skill or to
which no Skill is related, he uses (Avg(Tals) - UP) in place of Skill.

The Task Resolution Formula becomes:
</para>

<para>
<literal>
d10-d10* + (Avg(Tals) - UP) &gt;= TD
</literal>
</para>

<para>
where <literal>UP</literal> is the Untrained Penalty.
</para>

<para>
Note: Talent checks are conducted using this method, since they do not
involve a Skill. Because it is sometimes difficult to tell if a Task could
be done using a Skill or not, it is the responsibility of the GM to set an
UP of 0 for what he feels to be a true Talent check.

An example of a true Talent check would be holding one's breath to which a
character's Fitness would be applied using the formula d10-d10* + FIT &gt;= TD.
