Characters in RPGs are constantly trying to do things.
Picking pockets, casting Spells, haggling the price of an item with a
shopkeeper, etc. Whenever a character attempts to do something, it is
referred to as a Task. DNet uses the same consistent format for all
Tasks. Whether you are swinging a sword, picking a lock, or fast-talking
a town guardsman, you will always use the same game mechanics.
