<sect1><title>Reroll Method</title>
<para>
For Task Resolution, DNet uses two ten sided dice of contrasting colors.
Each dice can generate a result from 1 to 10: the 0 on the dice is considered
to be a 10.

Before rolling, choose which dice will be the positive dice and which will be
the negative one. In the examples below, the white dice is positive, while
the black one is negative. You then roll the two dice and substract the
negative one from the positive one.

Black dice (-): 7

<para>
When you roll a 10 on one (or both) dice, you compute the partial result and
reroll the 10, adding or substracting the new roll, as appropriate. If you
also roll a 10 on the reroll, you add it to the partial result and reroll
again. You reroll as long as you keep rolling 10s... or until the GM asks to
verify your dice. ;)
