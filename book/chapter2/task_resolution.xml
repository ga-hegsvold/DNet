<sect1><title>Task Resolution</title>
<para>
Tasks are resolved by rolling dice, adding the characters Skill or Talent to
the die roll, and comparing the result to a TD.
If the die roll plus the Skill or Talent is greater or equal than the TD,
the Task succeeds. If it is less, the attempt fails.

Optionally, the GM may use the amount by which the attempt fails or succeeds to
determine the degree of success or failure.
