<para>
These creatures do not really have a society. Imps fit in with whatever plans
their baatezu masters dream up, and they follow these schemes to the best of
their abilities. They may be weak and low, but they are smart enough to know
that they had better do what they are told. That is the only way they can
advance.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
Most importantly, imps realize that they have sidestepped one of the
most dangerous things about being a larva. By accepting the changes thrust upon
them, they avoid being turned into lemures, or other fodder for the Blood War.
</para>

<formalpara><title>Description</title>
<para>
The Lower Planes are full of larvae. Some of them are brought to the
attention of greater fiends and twisted into new and interesting forms.
When a baatezu twists a larva in just the right way, it becomes an imp.
</para>
</formalpara>

<para>
The poor imps are rigidly regulated and watched over by their baatezu masters.
When a mortal is judged "worthy," the fiends may make a gift of an imp to that
poor basher. Oho! It is no good gift! From that point on, the imp starts to
corrupt the mortal and drag his heart, inch by inch, closer to the grasp of
the baatezu.
</para>

<para>
Chant is imps that do well can be turned into baatezu.
If one of these little creatures is willing to start small and work up through
the ranks, it could go far.
</para>

<para>
Imps are about 60 cm tall, have wings and can fly. They also have poison in
their bodies. A lucky imp can even take out a dragon with a well-placed sting.
An imp can change its shape into any two of these forms: large spider, raven,
goat, or giant rat.
</para>

<para>
Imps muddle through centuries of existence as neuter beings.
When they have done enough good jobs to please their masters, they are assigned
a gender according to the traits of their work.
</para>

<para>
Imps are usually too busy to sleep. Their fiend masters and their mortal
masters always send them out to do evil things. Many imps do not care;
they do not need sleep at all. But sometimes they get tired of running around
and they hide in one of their animal shapes so they can rest somewhere.
</para>

<para>
As far as food goes, imps eat whatever they can get, as long as it is meat.
The creatures do not care if the meat is alive or dead, or if it has been
steeped in fear or gehreleth slime. It just has to be meat.
</para>

<para>
When the baatezu twist larvae into imps, they wring a few special powers into
their new servants. All imps have a strange ability to sense if you have
something bad in mind, and they can turn invisible to hide from anything that
worries them. They also love fire, cold, and lightning. And Believe it or not,
these puny creatures are very resistant to magic.
</para>

<para>
But like baatezu they keep a good distance when it comes to anything made out
of silver. Good for them they have such an amazing regeneration rate.
</para>

<para>
Also, imps are good at talking other berks into doing things. Their tongues
are like Elysium honney-cookies, dipped in the poisonous waters of Vudra.
</para>

<para>
If slain off their home planes, imps just reform back home after a
year and a day. But if you kill an imp on Baator, they are blasted into
eternal oblivion.
</para>

<para>
Like most small infernal creatures, imps act weak to tough berks and tough to
weak ones. To those they serve, they are ingratiating and endlessly helpful.
But they lord their little might over any sods unfortunate enough to come under
their power.
</para>

<para>
Most of them are also very concerned about their potential advancement.
If you offer one a hand up on the food chain, you might earn its loyalty,
at least for a small time. But oho! These alliances don't last long,
and if you count that they will, you might as well count yourself right into
the dead-book, because that's exactly where the little horrors would like to
put you, mortal.
