Introduction
------------

The following tables attempt to provide players with an universal method
for the computation of the Source and Conductor TDs of their spells.
These tables apply to mage spells, psionic powers, priest spells, spirit
magic, etc.

Our goal in creating these tables was to provide a set of guidelines to
balance the effectiveness of the various types of magical powers that
the characters can develop. We especially wanted to avoid that one class
of magic users (mages, psionics, priests, ...) become far too powerful
relatively to the others, destroying the balance of the game.

Most of the time, the Source and Conductor task difficulties calculated
with these tables will be correct. However, it can happen that you
create a spell with calculated TDs that are either too high or too low.
In this case, you can always fudge the TD by a few points up or down,
+ with the game master's permission. If you feel uneasy about fudging the
+ spell TDs, you can always contact the the DNET team for advice.

You are encouraged to submit your spells to us so that we can add them
to the standard spell library. When you submit your spells, list all
the factors that affect the spell difficulty, and provide a good
explanation of why you tweaked the Source and Conductor TD if you had
to resort to this to balance the spell with the standard ones.

The term "magic user" denotes magicians, priests, psionics, shamans,
etc. The term spell refers to the magical effects created by magic
users.

General Principles
------------------

-> The Source TD represents the amount of magical energy required to
   cast the spell successfully. Gathering this energy is tiring and
!  the fatigue created by a spell is equal to one fifth of the
!  the Source TD (rounding up).

-> The Conductor TD represents the complexity of the manipulation
   of the magical energy. Manipulating this energy takes time and
!  the casting time of a spell is equal to the Conductor TD,
!  in seconds; the minimum casting time is one second.

-> Spells that rely on brute for will have a high Source TD.
   Spells that rely on finesse of action will have a high Conductor
   TD.

! -> Magic cannot create permanent objects or beings without 'Djiang' (a
!    very rare magical substance). A mass of 'Djiang' equal to one tenth
!    of the mass of the being created is necessary for a living being to
!    remain after the spell duration. A mass equal to one fifthieth of
!    the mass of a created inanimate entity is required for it to remain
!    stable. The GM should set the cost of Djiang to more than fifty
!    times that of the second most expensive material, for obvious
!    reasons. The Djiang is always consumed during the casting and will
!    be lost even if the spell fails.

! -> Modifications made to non-living and non-magical entities always
!    remain after the spell duration expires. In the case of living and
!    magical entities, the change only remains if it is a physical
!    modification that can be sustained by the normal metabolism of the
!    entity. The spells that fall in this category are generally related
!    to healing, resurrection or memory recovery. Damage causing spells 
!    are also permanent. Other effects can be made permanent if some
!    Djiang is used during the casting. 

! -> The magic created by the caster activates only within the spell 
!    range. However, a target that gets out of the range of the spell 
!    after its activation still suffers the spell effects. A fear spell 
!    works even after the target has fled outside the spell range. In 
!    the same manner a fly or levitation spell is still active when the
!    target gets out of the range of the spell.
   
!    Note that for area of effect spells, part of the area can fall 
!    outside the range but the area center must remain within the range. 
!    The spell range is always relative to the caster.

Rituals
-------

There will be rules by which you can lower the task difficulties of
spells through an appropriate ritual. Such rituals will also allow
magic users to work collaboratively. Through rituals, magic users will
thus be able to perform spells that are normally too difficult for
them to cast.

Spells components
-----------------

Spell components that exploit the inherent magical aspect of some
materials or creatures will lower either the Source TD, the Conductor
TD or both. Nothing has been decided on this issue and suggestions
are welcome.

Basic Principles for the Task Difficulties
------------------------------------------

Each spell is divided into three distinct parts:

1) The infrastructure: determines the base cost of the spell
   Includes: range, duration, precision of area center, directness of
             application of source and conductor, complexity of system
             affected, difficulty of resisting the spell.

2) The intensity: everything that is related to the strength of the
                  spell effects
   Includes: hit points healed, damage, mass, speed, maneuverability, ...

3) The extent: the expanse of the spell, in space and time
   Includes: number of targets (affects both Source TD and Conductor TD),
             area of effect (affects Source TD),
             duration (affects both Source TD and Conductor TD).

These parts are then combined in the following manor to determine the
Source TD and Conductor TD:
  Infrastructure + (Intensity x Extent)

Spell Creation Template
-----------------------

The following template can be used to ease spell creation.

Spell:
Source:
Conductor:
Source TD:
Conductor TD:
! Fatigue: Source TD / 5 (round UP)
! Casting time: Conductor TD (in seconds) or 1 second, whichever is greater
! Duration: 
! Range: 
! Resisting TD: 

Write one or more paragraph describing the spell, its effects, range,
duration and sample applications.

Base TD
-------

The base Source and Conductor task difficulties is of -10. This
difficulty will be modified by the various parameters that affect the
difficulty of the spell. The Source and Conductor TDs are modified
independently.

==============
Infrastructure
==============

This section describes all the modifiers to the Source and Conductor TDs
that are related to the Infrastructure cost of the spell. Apply only the
modifiers that are pertinent to your spell.

Some of these modifiers affect only the Source or Conductor TD, while
others affect both. Each of the modifiers lists which TD is affected.

Range (S&C)
-----

Modifies the Source and Conductor TDs.

Range is the distance from the caster. No effects of a spell can
activate beyond its range. However, effects do not disappear if the
target gets out of range after it has been affected by the spell.

Rule of thumb: add 5 to the TD modifier each time you quadruple the
range.

-------------------------

--------------------------

+ Activation
+ ----------

+ Modifies both the Source and the Conductor TD.

+ If the spell does not take effect immediately after the casting is
+ completed, the mage must set up a mechanism to trigger the spell
+ activation. This mechanism increases slightly the amount of magical
+ energy required for the spell and complicates its casting.

+ There are generally two types of activation mechanisms:

+ Delay: the spell activation can be delayed to any time after the casting
+        by adding +2 to Source TD and +5 to Conductor TD. The presence of
+        the dormant spell can be still detected and the spell can be
+        removed through normal means.

+ Conditional activation: a spell can be triggered by one or more situations,
+        words, etc. The Source TD is modified by +2, while the Conductor TD 
+        modifier is dependent on the number of activation conditions.
       
+        +----------------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
+        | Number of Conditions | Source TD modifier | Conductor TD modifier |
+        +----------------------+--------------------+-----------------------+
+        |          1           |         +2         |           +5          |
+        |          2           |         +2         |           +8          |
+        |          4           |         +2         |           +11         |
+        |          8           |         +2         |           +14         |
+        |         16           |         +2         |           +17         |
+        +----------------------+--------------------+-----------------------+

+ Control Transfer
+ ----------------

+ Modifies both the Source and Conductor TD.

+ Once the spell is cast, its control can be transferred to another
+ intelligent being at a cost of +7 to the Source TD and +15 to the
+ Conductor TD. This increase in difficulty si due to the mechanism that
+ the mage must set up for the target to control the spell easily. Of
+ course, the mage must still explain to the target how to control the
+ spell. The control mechanism can involve movement, words, simple 
+ thoughts, etc.

+ [Note: The +7 +15 includes a +5 +5 to compensate for the -5 -5 of the
+ Touch range].

+ Control Transfer Range
+ ----------------------

+ Modifies the Source and Conductor TDs.

+ This range determines the maximum distance between the mage and the
+ intelligent being to whom the control of the spell is transferred. Use
+ the range table to determine the Source and Conductor TD modifiers.

Precision of area center
------------------------

Modifies the Conductor TD.

Only applies to area of effect spells, not spells that target individual
beings. The Conductor TD is raised as the precision of the targeting is
increased. For example, a weather spell that can tolerate an imprecision
of 100 meters on its central location will see its Conductor TD reduced
relatively to another spell which requires a precision of 1 meter on the
center of its effects.

Distance from center indicates the maximum distance at which the center
of the spell can appear, relatively to the center specified by the mage
during the casting.

16.1         10        5cm
----------------------------------------------

Complexity of the spell action
------------------------------

Modify both the Source and Conductor TD.

The complexity of a spell depends both on the type of action performed
by the spell and on the complexity of the system the spell affects, for
spells that alter the internals of a system. To obtain the total spell
complexity, add the action complexity modifier to the system complexity
modifiers.

------------------------------------------------------------------
TD Modifier       Complexity of the action
------------------------------------------------------------------
     +1           Mild (movement, minor alterations, ...)
     +3           Moderate (healing, damage, teleport, protection,
                            transformation, ...)
     +5           High (creation, destruction, ...)
+   +25           Godly (resurrection, instant death)
------------------------------------------------------------------

All spells that affect the structure of a system (polymorphing spells,
charm spells, creation or destruction spells, healing, ...) must use the
System type and System status tables to raise the Source and Conductor
TDs. This includes spells that cause internal damage (such as a reverse
of a healing spell), but not spells that cause external damage as the
result of an effect (such as a Fireball spell).
 
The total modifier to TDs is calculated by adding the appropriate
modifiers from the two tables below.

---------------------------------------------------------------
+TD modifier    System type (Type of system that can be affected)
---------------------------------------------------------------
   +1           immaterial (energy, fire, ...)
   +2           gases, liquid (or similar)
   +3           uniform solids or force fields, ...
   +4           vegetals, complex solids or force fields, ...
   +5           animal or animated being
   +8           magical or extraplanar entity
---------------------------------------------------------------

> I changed the table below since there was an overlap with
> the system type

---------------------------------------------------------------
+TD modifier    System function targetted 
---------------------------------------------------------------
   +0           none (or dead/inanimate system)
!  +1           metabolism/body
!  +2           reasoning/memory/mind
!  +5           soul
---------------------------------------------------------------

Add 5 to this modifier if the spell is an area of effect spell that
targets the internals of a system, as area effects are not precise by
nature and are thus not well suited to affect directly the internal
structure of entities.

! Use all the system function modifiers that are appropriate to the spell.
! A spell to hold a person immobile would use a system function modifier
! of +1 (metabolism), while a spell to charm the same person would
! require a modifier of +2 (reasoning/memory/mind), and a spell
! to switch bodies with them a modifier of +8 (body + mind + soul).

Difficulty of resisting the spell
---------------------------------

Affects Conductor TD.

If the spells affect directly the target (charm spells, some damage
inducing spells, ...), then the Conductor TD is modified by the TD of
target resistance roll.

TD Modifier = Resistance TD      (-5 minimum)

--------------------------------
TD Modifier       Resistance TD
--------------------------------
    -5                -5 or less
    -4                -4
    -3                -3
    -2                -2
    -1                -1
     0                 0
     1                 1
     2                 2
     3                 3
     4                 4
     5                 5
    ...               ...
--------------------------------

+ If a spell does not specify a resistance TD, then the resistance TD is
+ considered to be 0 and the nature of the resistance roll is to be
+ decided by the GM. Note that a spell that works only on willing
+ targets would generally have a resistance TD of -5.

Direct application of the Source(s)
-----------------------------------

Modifies the Source TD.

If the effect of the spell is not a direct application of the source(s),
then the Source TD is raised. Each source that is used in the spell
modifies the Source TD independently. For example, if a spell uses a
collateral source and a remote source, then its Source TD is modified by
a total of +15.

Any Source is opposite if there is another Source in the same school
that is more appropriate for the effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TD Modifier       Directness of application (sample spell)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   +0             Direct (Healing with Celestial Power of Daylight)
   +5             Collateral (Any physical effect with Kundalini)
   +10            Remote (Transmuting with Elemental Power of Energy)
   +20            Unrelated (Telekinesis with Elemental Power of Energy)
   +1000          Opposite (Creation using Elemental Power of Entropy)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Direct application of the Conductor(s)
--------------------------------------

Modifies the Conductor TD.

If the effect of the spell is not a direct application of the
conductor(s), then the Conductor TD is raised. Each conductor that is
used in the spell modifies the Conductor TD independantly. For example,
if a spell uses a collateral conductor and a remote conductor, then its
Conductor TD is modified by a total of +15.

Any Conductor is opposite if there is another Conductor in the same
school that is more appropriate for the effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
TD Modifier       Directness of application (sample spell)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
   +0             Direct (Fireball with Elemental Fire Focus)
   +5             Collateral (Heating things with Elemental Fire Focus)
   +10            Remote (Healing with Elemental Water Focus)
   +20            Unrelated (Fireball with Celestial Light Focus)
   +1000          Opposite (Moving things with Celestial Aurora Focus)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

=========
Intensity
=========

This section describes all the modifiers to the Source and Conductor
TDs that are related to the Intensity cost of the spell. Apply only the
modifiers that are pertinent to your spell.

Some of these modifiers affect only the Source or Conductor TD, while
others affect both. Each of the modifiers lists which TD is affected.

General Intensity
-----------------

+ Can modify either the Source TD, the Conductor TD or both. Use this
+ table only if you can't find a specialized table appropriate to your
+ spell. Note that this table can still be combined with other Intensity
+ table (mass, speed, ...).

This is a general table that modifiers both the Source TD and Conductor
TD depending on the strength of the effects created by the spell. Do not
use this table if your spell is oriented toward: Damage, Healing, [Mind
Control], ... There exists tables for those particular effects that are
a better guide than this general Intensity table.

------------------------------------------
TD Modifier       Intensity of the effects
------------------------------------------
     +2           Mild
     +5           Moderate
    +10           High
!   +20           Overwhelming
------------------------------------------

Intensity: Hit Points healed
----------------------------

Modifies the Source and Conductor TDs.

For healing spells, the TD is also modified by the number of hit
points healed.

-------------------------------------

Intensity: Damage done to target(s)
-----------------------------------

Modifies the Source TD.
If the spell causes damage, then its Source TD is modified by the
table below.

A spell that causes damage only through secondary effects (by making
the ceiling fall, for example) does not see its Source TD modified by
the table below. In general, if the main purpose of a spell is to cause
damage, then their Source TD should be affected by how much damage it
causes.

--------------------------------

Modifies the Conductor TD.

For spells that create movement, the Conductor TD is modified by the
maneuverability of the movement.

---------------------------------------------

    +7          High (360 degrees/round)
   +10          Excellent (720 degrees/round)
---------------------------------------------

======
Extent
======

This section describes all the modifiers to the Source and Conductor
TDs that are related to the Extent cost of the spell. Apply only the
modifiers that are pertinent to your spell.

Some of these modifiers affect only the Source or Conductor TD, while
others affect both. Each of the modifiers lists which TD is affected.

Note that the Extent modifiers multiply the Effects modifiers!

Area of Effect
--------------

Modifies the Source TD.

--------------------------------------------
Effects TD       Sphere         Cubes
Multiplier      (radius)    (5x5x5 meters^3)
--------------------------------------------
  x1             <= 3m           1
  x1.5           <= 5m           2
  x2             <= 10m          4
  x2.5           <= 15m          6
  x3             <= 25m          10
  x4             <= 45m          15
  x5             <= 70m          25
  x6             <= 100m         35
  x7             <= 135m         50
--------------------------------------------
[Radius = (5/3*Multiplier)^2; rounded to nearest nice value]
[Cubes = Multiplier^2 (rounded to a nice value)]

Number of Targets
-----------------

Modifies the Source and Conductor TDs.

If the spell specifies a number of targets, then it should not specify
an area of effect. The only limitation is that all targets should be
within range.

---------------------
Effects TD   Number of
Multiplier    Targets
---------------------
   x1           1
   x2           2
   x3           4
   x4           8
   x5          16
   x6          32
   x7          64
   x8         128
---------------------

Duration
--------

Modifies the Source and Conductor TDs.

The duration multiplier depends on the complexity of the spell action.
The more complex a spell, the shorter it is.

+ If the main goal of a spell is to cause damage or provide healing,
+ then its complexity is considered to be 20 for the calculation of the
+ duration multiplier. This artificial restriction is necessary to
+ preserve game balance.

> I changed the duration table to a gentler progression.
> The multiplier (for complexity = 19, 20) is now given by:
> multiplier = (log2(number of rounds / 5) + 4)/2
> (only for multipliers > 1)
> (multipliers < 1 are simply mirrored)

+ Damage and healing spells are considered to have a complexity of 20
+ for game balance. When it is clear from the spell description that
+ there are major limitations to the spell, this complexity can be lowered
+ proportionnally to the severity of the limitations. However, the
+ complexity set for duration purposes can never be brought below the
+ true complexity of the spell.

+ Spell limitation          Modification to duration category
+ -----------------------------------------------------------
+ Mild                                   -1
+ Moderate                               -3
+ Severe                                 -5
+ Crippling                              -10

+ Sample limitations
+ ------------------

+ Mild: - damage spell that stops working if target moves (or is unmoving)
+       - spell only works during the day

+ Moderate: - spell requires an expensive component
+           - spells injures the caster (casting sickness), making him
+             unconscious (ex: 50 injury points)

+ Severe: - damage spell that only activates each time the target says "foo".

+ Crippling: - spell only works during a solar eclipse
+            - spell kills the caster

+ These limitations only change the complexity for the calculation of
+ the duration multiplier and the true complexity of the spell still
+ affects normally both the Source and Conductor TDs. Moreover, if the
+ limitation is based on a conditional activation, the Source and
+ conductor TDs should include the cost of setting up this activation.
+ Finally, these artificial limitation modifiers can only be applied to
+ damage or healing spells, that already suffer from an artificial
+ penalty to duration.

+ Note that any limitation that has a workaround that reduces its
+ effectiveness is not considered to be a true limitation to the spell
+ and does not give any modifier to the duration category.
